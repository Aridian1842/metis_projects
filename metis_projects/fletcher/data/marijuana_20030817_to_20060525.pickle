VFake police checkpoints can be used to find illegal drugs, a state court of appeals has ruled. The decision reversed a lower court ruling in the case that began in 2000 outside Telluride, where police posted signs warning of a narcotics checkpoint near a bluegrass festival. The police hid and then pulled over anyone who appeared to dispose of narcotics before reaching the checkpoint. Although the appeals court said that drug checkpoints are illegal, it held that in this case the initial cause for the vehicle search was legitimate because Stephen Roth, 60, threw a marijuana pipe from his vehicle and was stopped for littering. Additional narcotics were found in his car. Mindy Sink (NYT)

VThe marching band, the words of gospel and the rousing speeches about the need to stop black-on-black violence, all of these traditional highlights of the annual ''Love Yourself, Stop the Violence'' rally in central Brooklyn were there again yesterday. But one critical ingredient was missing: City Councilman James E. Davis, the Stop the Violence founder, a black man shot dead by a black man less than a month ago. In 1990, Mr. Davis founded the Stop the Violence group as a way to console families of murder victims and to seek ways to prevent more violence, particularly that done by blacks to other blacks. Now the city's political elite tried to do the same for Mr. Davis's family and friends.

VThe Mexican authorities announced today that they had arrested eight drug traffickers considered to be ''the backbone'' of a violent cartel responsible for smuggling some 30 percent of the cocaine, heroin and marijuana sold in the United States. Armando Valencia Cornelio, who has also eluded the United States authorities since 1999, was arrested along with seven other men at a bar in Tlajomulco de Zúñiga in Jalisco State in an joint operation by prosecutors and the military, the authorities said. The men were arrested in what officers described as a ''surgical'' strike in which no shots were fired.

VQ. I recently bought my first co-op apartment, and there is one small problem: someone who shares my bathroom vent smokes pot incessantly, and I can smell it throughout my apartment. It happens to be the kind that smells like skunk. Short of taping up my vent, which I'd prefer not to do, is there anything I can do about this? . . . Jodi Miller, Manhattan. A. Arthur I. Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer who is also vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said that most proprietary leases prohibit tenant-shareholders from allowing odors to escape into the building, or to do ''anything which will interfere with the rights of other lessees or unreasonably annoy them.''

V''I SAW in your eyes that you hate the world,'' Jennifer Aniston tells Jake Gyllenhaal in THE GOOD GIRL (2002). ''I hate it too.'' Ms. Aniston's character, a soul-sick small-town discount-store clerk, goes home every night to her house painter husband (John C. Reilly) who spends most of his time drinking beer, smoking marijuana and watching television with his lethargic best pal. When a handsome, brooding young cashier (Mr. Gyllenhaal) is hired, she's ripe for a reckless affair. The story also involves a Bible study group, sexual blackmail, fertility tests and possibly poison blackberries. Miguel Arteta directed -- Saturday at 10 p.m. on Cinemax. Wei Minzhi (Minzhi Wei), a 13-year-old substitute teacher, is determined to be paid the 50 yuans she was promised for the job. But in Zhang Yimou's heartfelt drama NOT ONE LESS (1999), there's a catch. If students drop out of school while she's there, she gets nothing. So imagine her panic when she learns that a third grader has run away to the city to get a job. Wei follows him, and while figuring out the costs of bus tickets and how many bricks they'd have to carry to earn that amount, her students learn a lot of math. Ultimately, the power of TV saves the day, when Wei appears as a guest on ''Today in China'' -- Friday at 4 p.m. and Saturday at noon on IFC.

VGray Davis, the Democratic governor of California, may well become only the second governor in the nation's history to be recalled, but the election that removes him may well be a lose-lose-lose proposition for the state's Republican Party. There are several ways the Oct. 7 vote could set back the Republicans. The least probable is for the detested Mr. Davis to beat the recall. The party would also lose if Mr. Davis is replaced by another Democrat, most likely Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, who is running just behind the Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger in the polls.

VThe windows on one side of Desiree Bentsen's third-floor apartment overlook the hot concrete courtyard of the Ocean Village public housing complex in the Rockaways. Coarse arguments, loud rap music and sometimes the sound of gunfire waft in. But the windows on the other side of her apartment overlook a very different scene -- the Atlantic Ocean and a pristine stretch of beach -- and let in the roar of the waves, the squawks of sea gulls and the smell of salt air.

VPolitical pundits have talked about the selling of political candidates for years, but the campaign to elect Arnold Schwarzenegger governor of California is giving the phrase new meaning. Mr. Schwarzenegger's plunge into politics has created waves of renewed interest in the books and movies from his 30-year career in bodybuilding and Hollywood. Film studios, publishers and retailers eager to capitalize on the public fascination with his new career are rushing after the campaign bus, hocking their wares and pumping up his already colossal public persona.

VThe inmate accused of strangling John J. Geoghan, the former priest who was a pedophile, was a ''highly aggressive,'' emotionally disturbed child who was placed in a state residential center at 8, according to records of his trial for a murder in 1988 that were released today. The inmate, Joseph L. Druce, 38, told his lawyer today that he had killed Mr. Geoghan to avenge his victims, the lawyer, John LaChance, said. Mr. LaChance said he was quite likely to pursue an insanity defense in the killing, which was carried out on Saturday in a protective custody unit that Mr. Druce shared with Mr. Geoghan at the Souza-Baranowski maximum-security prison in Shirley.

VUnder different circumstances, John Capel might be an Olympic champion at 200 meters or a kick returner and receiver in the National Football League. In the space of five months, though, he ruined two careers out of haughtiness, anger, despair and involvement with marijuana, making his name not with medals won but with opportunities lost. In the time it takes to run half a lap, though, this cool and rainy evening grew celebratory and redemptive in a way the 2000 Sydney Olympics had been dispiriting and ruinous.

VJust before I entered my teenage years, when cable suddenly made more channels available than there were shows to fill them up, ''North Dallas Forty'' seemed to be on TV all the time. The movie, based on a novel by Peter Gent, a former receiver for the Dallas Cowboys, is about a depraved professional football team, and as a kid I couldn't bear it. The players are loathsome cretins whose hatred for one another is matched only by their hatred for themselves. The coach is a cold, vicious tyrant, the games are murderous spectacles. The locker room is worse: with discomforting regularity, a hypodermic needle is jabbed into a player's mangled knee, and then he's good to go. Nothing -- not even the inept Joe Pisarcik's seemingly endless tenure as the starting quarterback for my beloved New York Giants -- was more depressing than this movie. I loved sports; I even loved Pisarcik, in a way. Why was this behind-the-scenes nihilism getting mixed up with my sports? These days, of course, it's impossible to keep these things separate. The ''purity of the game'' -- always an illusion, but at least a sustainable one then -- has been overwhelmed by reality. (Even Little League comes with its share of sordid off-the-field dramas.) Recent months have given us some especially sensational offerings: one of the N.B.A.'s greatest players is facing a sexual-assault charge, coaches at high-profile football programs have been done in by accusations of gambling or carousing with coeds or hanging out with strippers and a Division I basketball program is disintegrating after one of its players was murdered and his teammate was charged with the crime.

VThe federal appeals court in San Francisco yesterday overturned the death sentences of more than 100 prisoners in three states because judges rather than juries had made the crucial factual determinations in sentencing them to death. The court ruled that a Supreme Court decision last year striking down the capital sentencing laws in the three states and two others because they allowed judges to make those factual findings must be applied retroactively even to those inmates who had exhausted all of their appeals. The affected prisoners will be entitled, at a minimum, to a new sentencing proceeding, unless the United States Supreme Court reverses the appeals court's decision.

Parker was sentenced Friday in Paterson, N.J., two months after a jury convicted him of endangering the welfare of a child in the second degree. The same jury acquitted him of first- and second-degree manslaughter.

VAn Englishman once told me that although he was shocked at how poorly educated the average American is, he considered the self-educated among us to be the best-read people he'd ever met. His statement might have been engineered to satisfy two contradictory stateside penchants: our persistent, self-flagellating faith in the superior sophistication of Europeans and our conviction that if we set our minds and most of our spare time to it, we can remake ourselves into savants. A surprising number of people harbor the belief that they will become thoroughly well read -- whatever that means -- once they get a proper chance to apply themselves. Carry around a new book like ''The Well-Educated Mind: A Guide to the Classical Education You Never Had,'' by Susan Wise Bauer, and friends will leaf through it earnestly, dreaming of a day when they'll finally be conversant with Sophocles and René Descartes. Surely that's why Mortimer Adler's ''How to Read a Book'' remains in print more than 60 years after it first came out and Harold Bloom's ''How to Read and Why'' became a best seller in 2000. Although do-it-yourself Great Books reading programs like these have a loftier air than other self-improvement schemes, I suspect they're abandoned even more quickly than the latest diet plan or resolution to hit the gym four times a week. The benefits of slimming down and getting fit are obvious and uncontestable, after all, while the advantages of a familiarity with Plato's ''Republic'' remain somewhat obscure; unless you brag about it, no one's even going to know. Reading, like regular exercise, is one of those things people feel they really ought to do more of and yet never get around to, and as a result it's the subject of both guilt and a tut-tutting concern with regard to our fellow citizens. ''At least they're reading books,'' goes the response when some stuffed shirt deplores the popularity of the Harry Potter series and Oprah's Book Club. The act of reading has become a virtue in itself, regardless of the book read. The forlorn, unspoken hope is that like marijuana, a middlebrow novel might lead to stronger stuff.

VA lawyer for Michael C. Skakel, who was convicted last year of killing Martha Moxley 28 years ago in a gated enclave of Greenwich, Conn., said yesterday that she would seek a new trial based on allegations by a new witness that two Bronx youths had bludgeoned the 15-year-old victim to death with a golf club. While the conviction of Mr. Skakel, 42, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, appeared to close the books on a murder case whose blend of wealth and celebrity had spawned global news coverage, an appeal is pending, screenplays are in the works and supporters of Mr. Skakel, including his cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr., are still re-examining alternate theories in a largely circumstantial case.

VON June 26, 1996, the Irish journalist Veronica Guerin was gunned down in broad daylight as her car was stopped at a light: the gunman shot five bullets through the window, and she died almost instantly. Guerin was famous -- perhaps too famous -- for her investigations into Dublin's drug underworld. She had gotten scoops using assertive and sometimes unorthodox tactics: cozying up to criminals, showing up unannounced at the homes of politicians and thugs. Eventually, she got on the wrong side of John Gilligan, a marijuana kingpin with a bad temper and a violent streak. Although Mr. Gilligan was acquitted of her murder, two of his henchman were convicted in connection with it.

VIT has proven near impossible to ignore the rumors, the rampant music-media speculation. ''Outkast -- Divided Souls,'' one magazine cover suggested. ''Outkast Goes Their Separate Ways?'' asked yet another. Tired of the talk about their imminent demise, at a recent news conference the two men who make up hip-hop's most ingenious group vigorously denied they were disbanding. ''Everybody's saying Outkast is breaking up, Outkast is going their separate ways,'' said Andre 3000, who had come here with his partner, Big Boi, to pitch their new clothing line to a room of motley fashionistas. ''We just let them talk. It's good coffee conversation.''

VMaking a satisfying horror film is as difficult as cooking a perfect risotto. Split-second timing and a meticulous balance of ingredients are critical for achieving a rich but chewy consistency. The elements that make up ''Cabin Fever,'' a movie that finds an unusually potent blend of dread, gore and gallows humor, are as commonplace as rice, butter, cheese and broth. But the director and producer Eli Roth, who wrote the story and collaborated on the screenplay with Randy Pearlman, has cooked up a tempting teens-in-the-woods bloodbath that suggests a ''Blair Witch Project'' with the blanks filled in, the camera stabilized and the story embellished with an evocative score (by Nathan Barr) whose shivery texture is spiced with the sounds of buzzing flies.

VMost Fridays, Gov. Gray Davis wraps up his work week and heads far away from here -- 350 miles away, to his West Hollywood condominium. When George Deukmejian, a Republican, was elected governor in 1982 and settled here for two terms with his family, he got a chilly welcome from Democrats in the Legislature. They blocked him from moving into the governor's residence, and he lived in a rented house.

VINTENTIONALLY or not, all movies are time capsules, preserving in some form a particular historical moment. A few embody something more -- the imaginative history of their times. Such movies realize social anxieties and desires not yet fully articulated. ''The Manchurian Candidate'' (1962), which inaugurates Film Forum's John Frankenheimer retrospective next weekend, is such a movie, steeped in what Norman Mailer called ''that concentration of ecstasy and violence which is the dream life of the nation.'' Mr. Mailer was contemplating the 1960 Democratic Convention, which nominated John F. Kennedy, and ''The Manchurian Candidate'' belongs to a cycle of movies specific to the Kennedy era. Kennedy glamorized politics and embraced danger, and Hollywood responded in kind. The Kennedy scenarios of the early 60's -- ''Advise and Consent,'' ''Seven Days in May,'' ''The Best Man,'' ''Dr. Strangelove'' and ''Fail-Safe'' -- conceived American democracy as an excitingly perilous arena. Shot in sober black and white and populated by demagogues, dupes and traitors, such movies were delirious news bulletins that set American presidents and presidential candidates in the midst of some personal or public Armageddon.

VAl Leiter will arrive at Wrigley Field on Wednesday morning, go to his locker and begin his preparations for his afternoon start. He will try to convince himself of the importance of the game against the Chicago Cubs. He will forget his team's poor record and remind himself he is facing Kerry Wood, one of baseball's best pitchers, and that this game means everything to the Cubs. Leiter has to sell himself on the meaning of these games because reality and recent history tells him otherwise. He knows the Mets have served as the National League's enablers recently, handing out nearly automatic victories to contending teams. If a team needs extra momentum as it pushes for the playoffs, the Mets seem only too willing to oblige.

VEvery weekend true believers of one sort or another come together somewhere in America to celebrate an idiosyncrasy they hold in common: there are Trekkie conventions (still), conclaves for people who treasure Hummels, and festivals for banjo music. This weekend The New Yorker magazine will be the host of an event celebrating yet another charming obsession: reading. In a postliterate age the New Yorker Festival stands as the maypole of a dedicated and ferocious demographic, fanatics who view the author Zadie Smith as far more dynamic and adorable than J.Lo.

VOn the third day of his campaign, Gen. Wesley K. Clark struggled today to clarify his statement on Thursday that he would ''probably'' have voted for the Congressional resolution authorizing the invasion of Iraq. General Clark, a former NATO commander who has retired from the Army, never denied making the statement in an interview with four reporters on his chartered plane. But he seemed stunned by the headlines that it generated, as supporters worried that he had undercut his position as an antiwar candidate with military bona fides.

VPolice officers conducting a routine search through a building of clothing manufacturers in Chinatown discovered hundreds of marijuana plants hidden behind secret doors in a loft-style second-floor apartment, the police said. The officers were patrolling the building, at 39 Eldridge Street, on Thursday after having found someone trespassing, when someone walked out of a second-story door and the scent of marijuana wafted into the hall, the police said. Officers looked inside the door and saw marijuana plants, the police said.

At rush hour on Tuesday, a throng of potential customers exited the 125th Street subway station in Harlem. Some held crumpled $5 bills in their palms, and when they reached him there was a quick exchange of money and merchandise. What was in the bag? The answer would come every few minutes, when the seller barked, ''Newports! Newports! Marlboros!''

VPretty much from the moment that music ''file swapping'' made its way into the public consciousness by way of Napster, there has been a vaguely ''Reefer Madness'' quality to the discussion of what the practice has meant to its college-age-and-younger participants. We have heard again and again that this new generation is coming to believe that music is something you don't pay for but rather simply take. That idea is in the air again since the major recording labels recently started filing what they say will be thousands of lawsuits against people who have used file-sharing software like KaZaA to download songs they have not paid for. And the implication of that argument is ominous and meant to alarm us: file sharing is like a gateway drug that will make users unlearn their willingness to pay for movies, video games, books. What the music industry is doing might be thought of as administering a dose of tough love, an intervention that will remind wayward youth not just that stealing is wrong but also that we have a system here wherein goods and services carry a cost. It's called capitalism, kid, and chances are very high that your favorite recording artist -- and every other cultural figure you admire -- loves it. Better to learn this now and kick the download habit before it leads to harder stuff, like a general unwillingness to pay for material goods of any kind, or a failure to grasp the magic of a great brand. If these consumer delinquents don't get scared straight back to the mall, the cost to us all will be much greater than lost revenue for the music business. The very morals of a generation are at stake.

VRock stars may like to talk about dying young and leaving a beautiful corpse, but few of them do anything about it. So you have to admire the personal style of the country-rock pioneer Gram Parsons, who died 30 years ago this month. Parsons did for cowboy kitsch what Jackie Kennedy did for the Chanel suit. The onetime Byrd was also a pal of Mick Jagger's, an influence on the Rolling Stones and a mentor to Emmylou Harris. But while his famous friends lived to 401(k) another day, he checked out one night at the Joshua Tree Inn, near Palm Springs, Calif., a mere 26.

VGay marriage is the most contentious issue to emerge on the Canadian political scene since Quebec threatened to secede in 1995. Opinion polls show it cuts a fissure across class, age, regions, gender and religious lines -- a recipe for sharp discord in most societies, rich or poor. But this is Canada, a country that has never suffered a revolution or civil war, where compromise, consensus and civility are the most cherished political values.

VOn the Paramount studio lot, in a trailer near the corner of ''Fifth Avenue'' and ''38th Street'' on an ersatz New York set, Jack Black rubs his red-rimmed eyes with his beefy fists, trying to shake off the Tylenol PM he took last night. A White Stripes song bashes out of speakers wired to his iPod. Arrayed on the table in front of him are a bottle of Gatorade, a paperback copy of the Dalai Lama's ''Path to Tranquility'' and a magazine about trucks. It's 2 in the afternoon, the time that Black is usually just getting out of bed. ''I'm nocturnal by nature, like a vampire,'' he says. ''Two to 6 a.m. -- those are my best hours.'' The actor is here to make a music video for a song from his new movie, ''The School of Rock,'' and he needs to ramp up his energy level considerably for the comedic exertions today's shoot involves: leaping down stairs three at a time with arms flapping, hurling himself ''Dukes of Hazzard''-style over the hood of a car and erupting with all manner of crazed gesticulations and demonic grimaces. Stacked on the floor of the trailer are 200 posters for ''The School of Rock'' showing Black surrounded by a multiracial group of kids, holding a guitar and striking a lip-snarling pose. A sort of heavy-metal version of ''The Bad News Bears,'' the movie, which is set to open Oct. 3, stars Black as a slovenly would-be rock idol who bluffs his way into a job as a substitute teacher at an elite private school and recruits a class of high-achieving fifth graders to be in his band. He has just autographed each poster neatly with a black marker. ''I don't know who they're for,'' he says, ''but I've been assured every one I sign means 12 people who will see the movie.''

VFor all that has been written and spoken about addiction as a medical disease, most people, including most physicians, understand little about what draws people to drugs and keeps them hooked, often despite severe consequences and repeated attempts to quit. A better understanding of the pull and tug of addiction can help those who are hooked and those who want the monkey off their backs for good.

VThe Pharmos Corporation said the Food and Drug Administration granted ''fast track'' status to its experimental medicine that mimics the effect of marijuana to treat head trauma. The status will speed the application process for the drug, called dexanabinol, which is now in the last of three stages of testing usually required for approval. The drug is similar to marijuana's central ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol, without the euphoric mental effects, Pharmos said. Pharmos, which is based in Iselin, N.J., is seeking to enter a market for treating brain injuries that it said may be worth more than $500 million a year. Stock in Pharmos rose 52 cents, to $2.53.

VA selective listing by Times critics of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Museums * ''THE AMERICAN EFFECT: GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES ON THE UNITED STATES, 1990-2003,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, through Oct. 12. Exploring ways that artists throughout the world react to the United States as a superpower, this show of documentary films, videos, installations, photographs, paintings and objects by 47 artists and filmmakers and 3 collaborative groups runs from sunny side up to deep despair. There are reflections on America's military and industrial might, its treatment of minorities, its consumerism, its justice system, its marketing strategies, its religious evangelism, its celebrity worship and its interference with other governments. There are also expressions of admiration for the freedoms, the opportunities and the material achievements of a country unfettered by ancient traditions. A wacky installation by a French artist, Gilles Barbier, in the form of life-size figures offers a wry take on the United States through its aging comic book heroes, viewed in the setting of a nursing home and in the last stages of decrepitude. The show has its weak spots but is provocative and visually compelling over all. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 62+, $9.50 (Grace Glueck).

VPrime Minister Jean Chrétien, whose government is pushing for legislation that would decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana, said he might give it a try once it is no longer a criminal offense and only tickets are handed out. Mr. Chrétien, 69, who has announced that he will step down in February, said in an interview with The Winnipeg Free Press: ''Perhaps I will try it when it will no longer be criminal. I will have my money for my fine and a joint in the other hand.''

VIN the latest ''Terminator'' movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a robot who returns from the future to save a grand old civilization from chaos. In Tuesday's California recall election Mr. Schwarzenegger stands a chance of transforming a grand old political party, not just in California but possibly on the national stage as well. That prospect exhilarates national Republican leaders, even as some acknowledge that it carries risks as well. The election goes beyond the prospect of salvaging Republican pride in Ronald Reagan's backyard. For many Republicans, a Schwarzenegger victory also carries an even more tantalizing promise with it: ''rebuckling'' the Republican Sun Belt, so that a revitalized libertarian Western wing balances the party's currently dominant moralistic Southern wing.

VAs anyone who has ever moved here knows, New York is famously tough on its newcomers. For most of us -- whether born in Lubbock or Laos -- it is, at first glance, a source of endless intimidation, as indecipherable and unattainable as a well-bred East Coast lover. But time somehow collapses in New York, and within a decade the unattainable becomes commonplace, the love you feel for an impossible mistress turns into something like the love of a middle-aged child for an ailing parent. ''She has good days and bad days,'' we can say of the city, shocked that a figure that once lorded over us with such a mixture of authority and indifference can, in her weakened state, bring about our compassion and swift allegiance. New York is currently having one of her bad days: attacked by lunatics, drained of revenue by corporations decamped across the Hudson and quickly forgotten by a Congress and an administration that have never much cared for her superior ways. And it seems there are even bigger difficulties ahead; problems that are, as the social scientists would say, structural in nature.

VThe Supreme Court on Monday let stand a ruling by a federal appeals court allowing Arkansas officials to force a convicted murderer to take drugs that would make him sane enough to be executed. The justices opened their fall term by listing dozens of cases decided by lower courts that they reviewed during the summer recess and chose not to reconsider. In addition to the Arkansas case, they let stand a ruling by the South Carolina Supreme Court upholding a murder conviction for a woman who used crack cocaine and then delivered a stillborn baby.

The police said the man, Ambrose Kappos, 37, of Queens, was charged with burglary, stalking, harassment, aggravated harassment and criminal possession of marijuana after he entered the Manhattan Center, at 311 West 34th Street, which houses the Hammerstein Ballroom. ''She was playing at the Hammerstein Ballroom, security recognized the man as being a stalker -- based on past, documented history -- and therefore he was placed under arrest,'' said Sgt. John Grimpel, a police spokesman. Tina Kelley (NYT)

VLUCILLE ARMSTRONG lived in the brick house in Queens for 12 years after her husband's death, and when she died, during a trip to Boston in October 1983, the first person into the house was Phoebe Jacobs. Mrs. Jacobs, 85 and a woman of some dash, had worked with Louis Armstrong since 1956, and is now the executive vice president of the Louis Armstrong Educational Foundation. Much had changed in the house since Armstrong's death in 1971, Mrs. Jacobs said last week. Among other things, she lamented, Lucille had thrown out his stash of marijuana from the basement. ''He always had the good stuff,'' Mrs. Jacobs said.

VOh, noble Jocasta, what a mess you are in! Unwittingly married to your own son, who is also the murderer of your husband, his father. Stephanie Blythe, playing Jocasta in the Metropolitan Opera's current production of Stravinsky's ''Oedipus Rex,'' glides across the stage, full-bodied, graceful, every inch a queen, her mezzo rich and plush, effortlessly dipping, then rising with a flutelike purity. ''Ne probentur oracula,'' she sings (''Let not the oracles be proved true''). Unfortunately, the oracles are right -- the worst has come to pass. As for Ms. Blythe herself, she is not a household name yet, but modern-day oracles see a golden reign. A writer for The Chicago Tribune has gone so far as to call Ms. Blythe ''a messiah'' of opera (with no apologies to Handel). A critic for Opera News wrote that he literally rose from his seat when he saw her sing the role of Auntie in Benjamin Britten's ''Peter Grimes'' at the Met. Anthony Tommasini, writing in The New York Times last year, said that when she sings Handel and Rossini, ''she seems the successor to Marilyn Horne.''

VEver since voters in California approved a 1996 ballot measure that legalized some medicinal uses of marijuana, the state has been locked in a legal and cultural battle with the federal government. Federal agents have raided farms where medicinal marijuana is grown, closed cooperatives where it is distributed and threatened to punish doctors who discussed it with their patients, all because federal law prohibits distribution or use of marijuana regardless of state law.

VThe Supreme Court added the Pledge of Allegiance to the docket for its new term on Tuesday, agreeing to consider whether public schools violate the Constitution by requiring teachers to lead their classes in pledging allegiance to the flag of ''one nation under God.'' The justices, who begin their daily sessions with heads bowed as the marshal intones ''God save the United States and this honorable court,'' accepted a case that, like the affirmative action and gay rights cases of the last term, places the court at the center of a public controversy. Justice Antonin Scalia, who has made clear his view that the pledge is constitutional, will not participate, raising the possibility of a 4-to-4 tie.

VThe Supreme Court, in a silent rebuff on Tuesday to federal policy on medical marijuana, let stand an appeals court ruling that doctors may not be investigated, threatened or punished by federal regulators for recommending marijuana as a medical treatment for their patients. As a result, doctors in California and six other Western states where voters or legislators have approved marijuana for medical uses like pain relief may now discuss it freely with their patients without fear of jeopardizing their federal licenses to prescribe drugs. Advocates of medical marijuana greeted the court's action as a significant and surprising victory.

VTHEY MARCHED INTO SUNLIGHT War and Peace Vietnam and America October 1967 By David Maraniss Illustrated. 572 pages. Simon & Schuster. $29.95. Tomorrow is the 36th anniversary of a riot at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. The police use of tear gas to subdue rebellious college students made it memorable, but at the heart of the event was a different chemical: napalm. The Dow Chemical Company (''Our position on the manufacture of napalm is that we are a supplier of goods to the Defense Department and not a policy maker'') had sent a recruiter to the campus. His very presence was enough to set off a violent uproar. His name was William L. Hendershot, known as Curly. He had brought a ham sandwich for lunch.

And for the first time, regulators are hinting that those who order the drugs may face prosecution. ''It's illegal to import narcotics,'' Mark B.

VTHE Rehnquist Court's tilt toward states' rights has occasioned much gnashing of teeth among liberals and others who fear a serious erosion of federal authority. But last week the federalism revolution produced another, unaccustomed sound: cheers from advocates of medical marijuana, whose cause received a substantial boost when the court refused even to consider rescuing the federal policy of pursuing California doctors who advise their patients on using marijuana under the terms of the state's Compassionate Use Act. The California law, adopted by voters in 1996, is part of a vigorous grass-roots revolt against the ''Reefer Madness'' message emanating from Washington, asserting that marijuana threatens the nation's very civic fabric. Of the nine Western states within the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, seven now authorize marijuana use with a doctor's approval. Having failed to deter the voters, it was the Clinton administration that first decided to go after the doctors.

He is outlining efforts to reduce American and European trade barriers, combat money laundering that finances international terrorism and pump up the Canadian military. ''Canada is now in the position to take on the world and win,'' he told guests at a Liberal Party fund-raising dinner this week in Edmonton, Alberta. ''In the decade ahead I believe we Canadians will make history.''

VI belong to a club to which members can bring guests and pay a small charge for using sports facilities -- tennis, squash, platform tennis, swimming pool. I have been told that I am one of the few who actually sign for guests. This is all on the honor system. Am I wrong to think perhaps I should join the crowd of noncompliers? C.M., Bronx You are right to reject the ''everybody is doing it'' defense and honor the honor system. But the behavior of your fellow members, while a small matter, does raise some interesting issues. When a rule is widely flouted, those who adhere to it can feel like chumps and may eventually disregard it themselves -- whether it's paying your income tax honestly, paying your fare on the subway or paying heed to your vow of marital fidelity. Psychologically, it's tough to drive at 65 when everyone is zipping by you at 80.

VAccording to its publicist's Web site, the Exploited, a Scottish punk band, has been tear-gassed by the German police, banned from the Netherlands and ''caused more carnage than a multicar pileup'' during its 24-year career. But a few days ago the Exploited and another punk band, Total Chaos, were thwarted by no less a force than Canadian customs officials, who refused the bands entry to Canada from the United States on the grounds that some members had criminal records while others had lied to customs. But when that news was announced to a Tuesday night crowd waiting for the bands' show in front of the Medley, a club in downtown Montreal, fans funneled their anger at the show's cancellation into creating a multicar pileup of their own, starting the most violent riot this city has seen since the Canadiens won the Stanley Cup in 1993.

''He opened the class with it and said that no one had told him to talk about it. But he said that if anyone wanted to talk, he was there. No one did, so we moved on to history.''

VGidone Busch was a troubled man in need of help, the lawyer for his family said. What he got was 12 bullets, including one in the back. That was the argument of Myron Beldock, the lawyer for the Busch family, at the opening of the family's civil suit yesterday against the city and five police officers, claiming that the officers violated procedures and, with a frenzy of overreaction, turned a sad city moment into a tragedy.

VRobert A. Durst, the New York real estate scion on trial for the shooting and beheading of a 71-year-old neighbor, told a rapt courtroom on Wednesday how he came to this faded island on the Gulf of Mexico and donned a woman's wig after learning that detectives had reopened the investigation into the disappearance of his first wife 21 years ago. He said that he feared that what he said was a politically ambitious prosecutor, District Attorney Jeanine F. Pirro of Westchester, would unfairly have him indicted in connection with the disappearance to ''further her own career.'' Having spent six terrifying hours in a Mexican jail on charges of possessing marijuana in the 1960's, Mr. Durst said he could not bear the thought of going to prison.

VNow that the World Series is over, baseball can turn to its perennial off-season obsession: whither Pete Rose and the Hall of Fame? Rose, of course, accepted in 1989 a lifetime ban from baseball for gambling. In recent years, though, Bud Selig, the baseball commissioner, has opened the door to the possibility that he might cut a deal with Rose. Rose would presumably apologize -- and in return he would be eligible to take his place in Cooperstown.

VA few things stand out about this unprepossessing city. It just broke its own Guinness Book world record for the most lighted jack-o'-lanterns with 28,952. It claims to have the world's widest Main Street. And recently, Keene became the home of Justin Somma, a 26-year-old freelance copywriter from Suffern, N.Y., and a foot soldier in an upstart political movement. That movement, the Free State Project, aims to make all of New Hampshire a laboratory for libertarian politics by recruiting libertarian-leaning people from across the country to move to New Hampshire and throw their collective weight around. Leaders of the project figure 20,000 people would do the trick, and so far 4,960 have pledged to make the move.

Describing the autopsy of Premkumar Walekar, a 54-year-old cabdriver who was shot at a gas station in Montgomery County that morning, the state's deputy chief medical examiner said Mr. Walekar had died from wounds caused by a single bullet fired by a high-powered rifle.

VWhen the police arrested Robert A. Durst two years ago and charged him with killing and dismembering a 71-year-old neighbor, investigators believed they had arrested the kind of penniless drifter who often passes time on Galveston Island in Texas, at the end of Interstate 45. But when Mr. Durst put up $300,000 bail within 24 hours, making headlines across the country, they discovered that his family owned Manhattan real estate worth more than $2 billion. With the Durst murder case expected to go to the jury this week, authorities in Galveston are still coming to grips with the man who prosecutors say coolly and deliberately killed his neighbor, Morris Black, cut up the body ''like a side of beef'' and dumped the parts in Galveston Bay.

But there they were, alone on a hot August evening at a United States immigration checkpoint, surrounded by law enforcement officers wearing badges and guns. Eight-year-old José Cruz Velázquez held the hand of his brother Sergio, who was 6. The Mexican boys had been seized from a smuggler hired by their parents living without legal papers in Pennsylvania. They were two of a growing number of children traveling without families who have been snared in the net that American and Mexican agents cast to stop illegal immigrants from crossing the border.

Up to that time, many doctors had assumed that alcohol was so harmless that it was sometimes administered intravenously to women who were thought to be at risk of losing their pregnancies.

VIn an emotional, finger-pointing display, Howard Dean was repeatedly rebuked by his Democratic rivals at a debate here on Tuesday night for saying last week that he wanted to be ''the candidate for guys with Confederate flags in their pickup trucks.'' Dr. Dean, trying to explain his remark to a Iowa newspaper, invoked the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as he said that he was only arguing that Democrats had to win the support of all voters -- in particular Southern whites who had fled to the Republican Party -- to be competitive in 2004.

V''Informers must die'' was the motto of a Flatbush drug gang that prospered by killing and intimidating witnesses against it, a prosecutor said yesterday at the opening of a federal death penalty trial of a Brooklyn man accused of being a feared member of the gang. The ruthless silencing of witnesses ''is the rule by which he lives, it is the rule by which he kills,'' the prosecutor, Jack Smith, said at the opening of the murder, narcotics and obstruction-of-justice trial of Emile Dixon, a Jamaican immigrant with a history of drug dealing and weapons convictions.

VA former president of the Oyster Bay Chamber of Commerce has been arrested as part of a 10-month federal investigation into a loosely connected cross-country marijuana network, the Nassau County district attorney announced yesterday. Nine people were arrested last month. The former president, Lester Huffer, 57, of Locust Valley, was arrested on Oct. 7, although details were released only yesterday. Rick Hinshaw, a spokesman for the district attorney, said the release was delayed because others were still at large. Mr. Huffer is accused of selling an unspecified quantity of marijuana from his sign shop in Oyster Bay and from his Locust Valley home. If convicted, he faces up to 15 years in prison. He remains in the Nassau County Correctional Facility in $150,000 bail. His lawyer did not return a call for comment. Stacy Albin (NYT)

VPolice officers with guns drawn raided a high school in Goose Creek near Charleston, cordoning off a hallway in a search that netted no marijuana but loud complaints on Wednesday. ''Several officers did unholster their weapons in a tactical law enforcement approach,'' Lt. Dave Aarons said. ''There was no force whatsoever.'' Graham Boyd, director of the drug policy project for the American Civil Liberties Union, said, ''You absolutely cannot bring police with guns drawn into a school.'' Mr. Boyd said students under suspicion at Stratford High School should have been called to the principal's office to have their bags checked for drugs.

VMarijuana pills seem to relieve some symptoms of multiple sclerosis, according to research published in the medical journal Lancet. The study found that even though improvements could not be detected by doctors' tests, a greater proportion of patients taking the drug reported reduced pain and muscle stiffness than those taking fake capsules. Some experts said they were encouraged by the findings; others said any major effect would have shown up in the doctors' tests. A fuller report is online at www.nmss.org.

VFrom a defensive standpoint, Giants running back Tiki Barber probably looks like the best player to allow to catch a pass. Receiver Amani Toomer averages 20 yards a reception. Receiver Ike Hilliard can split a defense with a shifty move. Tight end Jeremy Shockey can turn a secondary into bowling pins. Barber usually lurks just a few yards downfield, with lots of linebackers in the area. Chances are, he has already taken a pounding on countless running plays, so teams let him lurk. But time after time, quarterback Kerry Collins finds him with short passes.

VBaron Davis was too quick and too accurate for Kobe Bryant last night, and the host New Orleans Hornets beat the Los Angeles Lakers, 114-95, for their first loss of the season. Davis made four 3-pointers and scored 23 points with 12 assists and 4 steals, and he also had plenty of help. P. J. Brown shot 7 for 7 and scored 20 points, David Wesley added 17 points and George Lynch scored 15 to pace six Hornets in double figures.

''Which of you are ready to admit to having used marijuana in the past?''

VREAL Neil Young loyalists will buy a new record just because they feel like they owe him the money. But until now, his forays into extended narrative (the films ''Journey Through the Past'' and ''Human Highway'') made most of his audience temporarily jump ship. With ''Greendale,'' loyalty pays off: what comes out of the jewel-box is a completely viable artifact, on the basis of the audio disc and accompanying booklet alone. The bonus DVD, featuring a solo live performance of the same basic material that's presented on the audio disc and in print, is nice but redundant. Better to consume this product by treating it as a hybrid between a printed work and a book-on-tape -- to read it as one reads a novel, because in fact that's what it is. Mr. Young has always been remarkable for his creative resilience, and this time he really has done something new, rendering into this combination of print and audio a novel that is surprisingly sophisticated and satisfyingly complete. He embeds the story line in musical arrangements sufficiently stripped down to recall the idea of a Homeric bard accompanying himself on his harp. The music supplies and modulates the tone of the work -- Mr. Young's familiar chiaroscuro palette -- or sometimes goes a little further to capture a lyrical feeling the words can't fully express: in the description of Mr. Young's accompanying text, ''you can't tell by listening to the songs, you have to listen to the instrumentals to get this.'' While the songs themselves dramatize the narrative's scenes, the printed text handles exposition and summary transitions, in an idiosyncratic manner that allows Mr. Young to speak directly to the reader.

VNonviolent drug offenders who complete judge-supervised treatment programs are significantly less likely to commit crimes again than those who serve prison time, according to a new study by an independent research arm of the New York State court system. The study underscores what New York's chief judge, officials at the United States Justice Department and local judges across the country have believed for years, without the benefit of formal research: that state-run ''drug courts'' offering court-supervised treatment programs are far better at preventing future criminal behavior than prison is, and that they do so at a fraction of the cost.

VRobert A. Durst, the New York multimillionaire who admitted that he had butchered his 71-year-old neighbor's body with a bow saw and dumped the parts into Galveston Bay, was acquitted of the man's murder on Tuesday. Mr. Durst told the jury that despite what happened afterward, the killing itself had been accidental and an act of self-defense. For many in the courtroom, it was a surprise ending to a strange trial. When a bailiff read the verdict, in a scene televised live nationally, Mr. Durst, who had faced up to 99 years in prison, looked stunned, his mouth agape as he gazed upward. A tight smile spread across his face. Moments later, he hugged his defense lawyers, softly saying, ''Thank you, so much.''

VJust as the sheepskin Ugg boot reaches the grimy, matted peak of its popularity, another wardrobe essential is trickling up from surf culture. The oversize pullover hooded sweatshirt -- the ''pully'' -- is popping up in high-end stores, slowly elbowing out shrunken cashmere hoodies, which have virtually become the symbol for Fashion Victim. A heavyweight cotton pully by Rogan (right; $195 at www.rogannyc.com) is cut high in the back so it doesn't droop sloppily over the hips, and the neckline is dropped so the hood doesn't clutch at the throat. At Satine, a West Hollywood boutique, a pully by Shopaholic is embroidered with birds and flowers ($105, 323-655-2142). Charlotte Ronson adds athletic-inspired detailing ($65 at Henri Bendel), while Lucien Pellat-Finet pays homage to the pully's laid-back roots by silk-screening an image of a marijuana leaf on the back of its $790 version (at Barneys New York).

VWHEN Forbes magazine splashed a marijuana leaf on its cover last month, John Buffalo Mailer weighed the propriety of flaunting such images in public. Mr. Mailer, who is just starting out in journalism, said he hoped never to run such a cover. ''It's a personal thing, but I don't believe we should be throwing that in people's faces,'' he said. ''I don't think that's our role.'' Mr. Mailer, 25, the son of Norman Mailer and Norris Church Mailer, speaks with the self-assurance of the handsome and intellectually well born. Yet his words begged a little clarification. Looming over him was a blowup of a magazine cover with Snoop Dogg holding a water pipe in each hand, accepting the honor of 2002's Stoner of the Year. Mr. Mailer, you see, is the new executive editor of High Times.

VThe melting pot boiled over in the quintuple bill of Latin rock at the Hammerstein Ballroom on Saturday night. Maldita Vecindad, Molotov and El Gran Silencio came from Mexico, Los Rabanes from Panama and Yerba Buena from New York City. Stylistic distinctions that might make sense north of the border were demolished; rapping, power chords and funk fused with rhythms from the English- and Spanish-speaking Caribbean, all in the service of a cheerfully rebellious good time. Fans shouted along and hurled themselves into mosh pits that sometimes covered the whole dance floor. Each band had a different multicultural mix. The lightest touch and most high-minded intentions belonged to Maldita Vecindad, the oldest group on the bill, formed in 1985. Its songs bounced and galloped, most rooted in Jamaican ska but with plenty of other Caribbean crosscurrents, including Afro-Cuban clave. Its lead singer, Roco, went bounding across the stage with rubber legs and a sardonic grin, while Sax was a one-man horn section, playing two saxophones at once or punching out trumpet lines. When Roco wasn't singing about love or music, he was dispensing political parables like ''Un Poco de Sangre Roja'' (''A Little Red Blood''), a funk song in which a street kid who washes windshields is killed by a fancy new car.

VNo result in any elite sport can be trusted with reasonable certainty to have been achieved without performance-enhancing drugs, a number of American scientists say. The continuing revelations of drug use have undermined, and perhaps even destroyed, the reliability of sport as fair play, they say. Whether fans believe this or care is another matter. While many fans are disturbed by athletes' gaining an unfair advantage, anecdotal evidence suggests that they have also come to accept chemical enhancement in a society in which the use of recreational and therapeutic drugs is widespread, as is physical enhancement through plastic surgery.

VWHEN the plane tickets for a cross-country trip arrived, my stomach swirled with a mixture of hope and dread. I love to travel and have no fear of flying, but I got a little queasy imagining the havoc my two young sons could wreak on a six-hour flight. My head filled with the sounds of tray tables flopping open, Airfone cords stretching and high-pitched cries of ''Mine!'' The first solution to pop into my mind was, of course, heavy sedation. But I firmly believe that parents should use unprescribed medication only as a last resort.

The two patrolmen tried to clear his airway when they noticed him choking. Mr. Sandoval, 24, was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital of ''asphyxiation due to aspiration of plastic bag.''

Daesean was struck with a larger caliber bullet. On Wednesday, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly announced the arrest of Jarrell Perry, also of Barbey Street, who he described as a marijuana dealer. He said that that Mr. Perry and two other marijuana dealers had opened fire on a rival group of dealers in front of the Hill residence. Jed Stevenson (NYT)

VTo the Editor: Your ''puff piece'' about John Buffalo Mailer and High Times magazine (''Who's Smoking Now?'' Nov. 16) let the magazine and its new executive editor off the hook all too easily. The article notes without irony that High Times is now supported largely by ads for ''horticultural supplies.'' Apparently, Mr. Mailer hopes that mainstream advertisers and newsstands will be ready to support High Times once it takes the photos of marijuana off the cover.

VFederal agents arrested 20 airport baggage and cargo handlers yesterday and charged them with running a decade-long drug smuggling operation that brought hundreds of pounds of cocaine and marijuana a year through Kennedy International Airport under the noses of customs officials. The arrests unveiled a criminal conspiracy of stunning duration, prosecutors said, in which the baggage handlers moved drug shipments worth tens of millions of dollars through the airport with virtual impunity. The smuggling operation also showed what federal officials called a vulnerability in the nation's airline security system.

VOne of them was chronically behind on his $1,150-a-month rent. Another lived with a girlfriend who has been on welfare for six years. At least one lived with his parents, and most of the others rented unadorned middle-class apartments in outer Queens or Brooklyn. All of them, prosecutors said Tuesday, are accused of helping to smuggle hundreds of pounds of cocaine and marijuana a year through Kennedy International Airport, in what federal officials have called one of the largest and longest-running criminal enterprises of its kind. The smuggling ring, which the police say included 20 airport luggage and cargo handlers and their accomplices, moved such large quantities of cocaine that agents called their investigation Operation Snowstorm.

VWillie Shaw, a senior guard on the St. John's basketball team, has been suspended indefinitely for violating team policy, Coach Mike Jarvis said in a statement yesterday. Jarvis and the university had no further comment, the statement said. Shaw will begin serving his second suspension within a year when St. John's plays Stony Brook tonight. He was sidelined for the first three games last season because he tested positive for marijuana. He had also been held out of the Red Storm's N.C.A.A. tournament loss to Wisconsin the previous season because of the violation.

VGrady Reynolds, a senior forward for St. John's, knows about performing when off-court matters take precedence. He played all of last season while facing an assault charge before the matter was resolved over the summer. So on Saturday night, with St. John's playing its first game without the senior guard Willie Shaw, who was suspended for the second time after his arrest on a marijuana possession charge, Reynolds helped the Red Storm turn what could have been a morale killer into a mere distraction.

VCanadians and Americans still dress alike, talk alike, like the same books, television shows and movies, and trade more goods and services than ever before. But from gay marriage to drug use to church attendance, a chasm has opened up on social issues that go to the heart of fundamental values. A more distinctive Canadian identity -- one far more in line with European sensibilities -- is emerging and generating new frictions with the United States.

VAfter the final buzzer had mercifully sounded, Mike Jarvis called it awful. He could have called Tuesday's 81-64 loss to Hofstra embarrassing or devastating. He could have mentioned how the game's bad taste had 4,164 fans stewing inside the building before they left in disgust. It really didn't matter how he described the game, because the play on the court left nothing unsaid. For St. John's, the thrashing inflicted by Hofstra was one of the worst moments in the 42-year history of Alumni Hall. It may get better this season and it probably can't get much worse, but there seemed to be a cold reality to Tuesday's defeat. St. John's basketball is in trouble.

VMarianne Boesky 535 West 22nd Street Chelsea Through Dec. 20 The sculptures in Liz Craft's entertaining show, most made of cast and patinated bronze, include a lifesize, naked and scraggy hippie sitting cross-legged and playing the guitar while emitting a plume of marijuana smoke; a series of ''Mountain Mamas,'' grotesquely obese sitting female figures with pointy, featureless heads; a giant cartoon hand on human legs with its middle finger defiantly raised; a small dragon reclining like a pet dog; and perhaps best of all, a curtain made of ridiculously oversize wooden beads.

VBy noon, when most of his players had left the practice gym for places he cannot control, Portland Trail Blazers Coach Maurice Cheeks was asked to reflect on the reputation of his troubled team. ''It's not a pretty image,'' he said, shaking his head and sighing. ''I'm not especially proud of the names I hear of a team that I'm the head coach of. All I can do is rehabilitate this team and try to make them people that people want to come see and want to be around.''

But Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski quickly silenced them Saturday when they took on St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis near the end of the Blue Devils' 79-58 victory over the slumping Red Storm. When the Cameron Crazies started chanting ''Fire Jarvis,'' it was Krzyzewski who shouted them down.

VTwo residents of the state's largest nursing home were arrested this weekend on charges of selling or possessing heroin, and two of its employees are being investigated after accusations of drug use and sales, Nassau County health officials said on Monday. The two residents were arrested Saturday afternoon after an eight-month investigation begun by the nursing home, the A. Holly Patterson Extended Care Facility, and carried out by the State Health Department. Officials of the nursing home said they were trying to remove drug users, but two of Holly Patterson's critics said the arrests represented only the public eruption of a hidden culture of drug use at the home.

If he successfully completes the program, the criminal charge will be dropped. Ryan Largay, 18, the son of Mr. Rowland's wife, Patricia, from an earlier marriage, appeared briefly before Judge Joan Alexander of New Britain Superior Court with his lawyer, Joseph Wicklow III, at his side. Neither Mr. Largay's parents nor Mr. Rowland appeared in court with him.

VA Brooklyn man whom federal prosecutors described as the most feared member of a murderous Flatbush drug gang was convicted yesterday of a sweeping 12-count indictment that included drug distribution and murder charges, including the charge that he killed a witness in an attempted murder case to silence him. The conviction could subject the man, Emile Dixon, 33, to the death penalty. The judge, Raymond J. Dearie of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, excused the jurors until Tuesday, when a second phase of the trial, determining the penalty, is to begin.

VA New York University student was high on drugs when he jumped to his death from a floor in Elmer Holmes Bobst Library at the university in October, the New York City medical examiner's office said yesterday. The examiner ruled that the death of the student, Stephen Bohler, on Oct. 10 was an accident, not a suicide. A spokeswoman for the examiner's office said that Mr. Bohler was under the influence of marijuana and psilocybin, which is found in mushrooms. He was 18 years old and was a first-year student from Irvine, Calif.

VA selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Museums ''BLACK BELT,'' Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, through Jan. 4. This exhibition of Asian-American and African-American artists sets the Studio Museum on a new, timely and more inclusive course, but the show itself is deeply flawed. With the martial arts paradigm Bruce Lee as the point of departure, most of the art sets out to examine cultural cross-fertilization and issues of identity; but it leans so heavily on popular culture that it is, paradoxically, completely impersonal. Notable exceptions include the work of Ellen Gallagher, Michael Joo, David Huffman and Iona Rozeal Brown. The standout is Paul Pfeiffer's tiny video, which manipulates the image of Michael Jackson dancing into a multi-armed, fully-weaponed bodhisattva. It alone recapitulates Mr. Lee's savage elegance in a form that it can call its own. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; students and 62+, $3; children under 12, $1 (Roberta Smith).

VSix foster-care children from the Bronx and Brooklyn and their legal guardians have filed a lawsuit against a Rockland County school and residential center, charging that the executive staff severely abused the children over the course of at least the last two years. The suit, which was filed on Wednesday in State Supreme Court in the Bronx, accuses the staff at the Edwin Gould Academy in Chestnut Ridge, N.Y., of carrying knives and guns, abusing drugs and alcohol, and beating, choking and illegally injecting their charges with antipsychotic drugs like Thorazine. It also alleges that some members of the staff offered to share marijuana with the children under their care and harassed them verbally, warning them to ''sleep with one eye open'' and telling them they would likely ''wind up dead or in jail.''

VA SIGN greets visitors at the entrance to the bedroom that Daesean Hill shared with his little brother in East New York, Brooklyn: ''Daesean and T.J.'s room. Keep out.'' The sign is adorned with Rugrats, the brothers' favorite cartoon characters. On the door frame are several lines marking off Daesean's height over the years. There is a big gap between the mark made last spring and the one made at the end of the summer. The bedroom is decorated with posters and action figures of superheroes: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the Hulk and Daesean's favorite, Spider-Man. The bunk bed is also a shrine to these heroes. Daesean's top bunk, of course, has Spider-Man sheets.

VAlmost lost in the seemingly petty details of hot tubs and gutters and work on a lakeside cottage done free under unexplained circumstances is the remarkable story of the man whose job now seems to hang by a thread. Long before his administration became a magnet for scandal, John G. Rowland was one of the true boy wonders of American politics. Elected to the Connecticut legislature at age 23, he became the youngest member of Congress four years later in 1984, and went on to win three terms as a Republican governor in an otherwise Democratic state.

VConnecticut Governor John G Rowland faces real possibility of being forced out of office after admitting that he was inaccurate when he said that no one else had done work on his Litchfield (Conn) cottage, when in fact some work was done by friends; Rowland has denied that any of his friends were given state work contracts in return, but his admission has prompted calls for resignation by Democratic leaders, ending decades of Rowland's seemingly teflon-like presence in Republican politics; photos (M)

VPERHAPS we'll never know why Mike Jarvis, the basketball coach at St. John's, was fired six games into the season. Each side -- coach and university -- told reporters yesterday that they were sworn to a legal oath of silence regarding the specifics of the sudden dismissal. But this was a stunning story in the saga of a conference losing luster and life force before our very eyes. Yesterday, one of the Big East Conference's cornerstone programs lost one of its high-profile coaches in a first: Jarvis is the first head coach to be fired during the season in the 25 years of the conference.

In big ways and small, Mr. Martin's first week in office has been marked by symbolic shifts in style and policy. The trend in Ottawa is already more businesslike and conservative -- friendlier to the United States and to the Canadian military.

VA high-profile college basketball coaching job became open yesterday after St. John's fired Mike Jarvis. He will be replaced in the interim with the associate head coach Kevin Clark. It was an abrupt end to what had been a successful, but increasingly tense, relationship between the coach and St. John's administrators. Over five seasons and six games at St. John's, Jarvis posted a 110-61 record and led the Red Storm to three N.C.A.A. tournament appearances -- including a berth in the 1999 regional finals in his first season -- and a National Invitation Tournament championship last season.

VCHRISTMASTIME in New York: the big tree, department store windows, roasting chestnuts (though they seem to have vanished). For me, the childhood holiday memories include those clichés. But they also include stories that are a little more personal and strange: like the time my family's house got robbed on Christmas Day and, a few years later, the time I got mugged on Christmas night. Part of living in Brooklyn in the 1970's and 1980's was being a crime victim. Houses were broken into, you got roughed up a few times on the street. Broken safety glass sparkled on the asphalt like mica. My father's house in Prospect Heights was burglarized twice; once they took his cream-colored Fender Bullet guitar (he's still mad about that).

It is a reminder of a time when the Trail Blazers were the N.B.A.'s premier team and the city's revered supermen. The photograph shows a parade the day after the Blazers won the 1977 championship. More than 100,000 fans crammed onto a downtown street to celebrate. Businessmen hung out of windows while other fans vied for space on fire escapes, light posts and the roofs of parked vans.

VHIGHLIGHTS LONDON: MISSING MASK -- Stolen or simply mislaid? That was the question yesterday surrounding the death mask of the British painter J. M W. Turner (1775-1851). Regarded as a treasure of the Royal Academy of Arts in London, where Turner was a distinguished pupil, a teacher and a generous benefactor, the mask has not been seen since the mid-1980's, the BBC reported. Staff members thought it had been mislaid, but now the academy has informed the Art Loss Register, which maintains a database of stolen works, that the mask has disappeared. An academy spokeswoman, said, ''We're confident the mask will be found, but we have to consider all the possibilities.'' A second mask taken from the same mold is owned by the National Portrait Gallery in London. The academy said its loss was discovered after a request last year to borrow the mask.

His mother, Andree Maitland Dean, is eager to emphasize that the family's three-bedroom apartment there is not luxurious. ''Look around,'' Mrs. Dean said in a recent interview, gesturing at the quarters where her boys grew up. ''Howard didn't have the least bit of a glamorous upbringing.''

She was among more than 750 people killed this year in Puerto Rico, a small island (only twice the size of Rhode Island) with a homicide rate more than three times the United States average. More murders per capita take place here than in any American state, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

VEARLY on in his furniture designing career, which is to say just about a year or two ago, Hughes N'Cho-Allépot found a seasoned carpenter to make his pieces. But with each new design, the carpenter would balk. The sofa was too big, he'd protest, the back of a chair too short. But Mr. N'Cho-Allépot, a Parisian turned New Yorker and a political-science student turned designer, is as sure of himself as a man can be. (As he is the grandson of an African tribal chief, it is quite possible that Mr. N'Cho-Allépot's confidence is in his blood.)

VEddie Griffin is searching for an apartment in New Jersey, but he is not looking for a roommate. He believes he is finally ready to live alone. Griffin has spent much of the past six weeks at the Menninger Clinic in Houston, where he says he rediscovered his passion for basketball and his appreciation for life. After undergoing therapy for depression and substance abuse, Griffin is stepping back onto a basketball court for the first time since he was charged with felony assault more than two months ago.

VA Brooklyn man defended himself and his girlfriend by shooting and killing a man who broke into their apartment on Sunday night, the police said. The couple were later arrested after the police found more than a pound of marijuana they said belonged to them. The couple, Sheldon Barrow and Beverly Seales, told the police they were home around 6:45 p.m. at 600 East 18th Street in Kensington, when two men with guns pushed inside and demanded money. Mr. Barrow retrieved a pistol and used it to shoot one of the intruders, whom the police identified as Fisher Canton, 29, of Brooklyn, in the face. The second intruder fled.

VThe police auction has always been a depressed and homely cousin of the chipper yard sale, a gray Saturday morning in a municipal back lot, grim strangers sifting through boxes full of other people's losses. Do I hear $2 for the boy's mountain bike? Very good, sir. What about $3? Those days are over in New York City, whose Police Department has joined some 300 others around the country in clearing out crowded property rooms online, unloading hundreds of television sets and car stereo speakers, leather coats and compact discs, cellphones and anything else that once belonged to someone else and is now just taking up space on a locked storeroom shelf.

VSOME 14 years ago, Andrea Leibman by her own admission was living a life of dull domesticity. ''I was a mom with a minivan and two kids,'' said Mrs. Leibman of West Hartford, adding, ''I felt dowdy.'' Then Mrs. Leibman came into a bit of money and acquired a butterfly tattoo, a sexy white '89 Corvette and a vanity plate, reading ''MIDLFC,'' short for midlife crisis. Her husband, she joked, said it was better than acquiring a boyfriend.

VHaving just turned 18, Billy Besk set out from his home in New Hampshire to visit San Francisco. Along the way, Mr. Besk dropped into Iowa, where he found some marijuana growing at the roadside. He stuffed about 20 ounces into a big red duffel bag and continued to California, intending, he said recently, ''to make some money'' during his trip.

VA task force of 150 police officers will help impose order on 12 of New York City's most violent schools under an initiative announced yesterday by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to curb school violence. Together, the 12 schools enroll less than 3 percent of the city's 1.1 million schoolchildren. But through Nov. 30, they accounted for 13 percent of serious crimes reported this school year and 11 percent of all incidents in the city schools, officials said.

p12848
ssVabstract

VMayor Michael R Bloomberg says task force of 150 police officers will be sent to 12 of New York City's most violent schools to curb school violence; 12 schools enroll less than 3 percent of city's 1.1 million schoolchildren, but they account for 13 percent of serious crimes and 11 percent of all incidents reported in city schools this school year; list of schools was compiled over winter break by Dept of Educ, Police Dept and teachers' and principals' unions; list includes 10 high schools and two middle schools, concentrated in Brooklyn and Bronx; poverty rates at schools range from low 20 percent at Canarsie HS in Brooklyn to nearly 90 percent at JHS 22 in Bronx; teachers' and principals' unions have long pressured Bloomberg to address issue of school violence, but he took on issue only after reports that suspension system had broken down in course of his restructuring of school system and that, as result, violent students were languishing in very hallways and classrooms where their offenses occurred; schools on list had average six times as many assaults as other city schools last school year, and nearly seven times as many weapons incidents; photo; list of schools; map (M)

VFashion devotees unfortunate enough not to have planned a winter holiday in Nevis or Oaxaca often find themselves suffering from consumer impatience in January. Too forward thinking to shop the winter sales, they feel compelled to buy something springlike right now. ''This is the gateway purchase,'' said Sarah Easley, an owner of Kirna Zabête, coining the phrase as she spoke. ''In high school we were taught about the gateway drugs, like alcohol and marijuana. Well, this is sort of like that.''

VIt is a favorite line of Pete Rose's, and like so many things from his past, it is haunting him now. In his latest autobiography, Rose again asserts that he thought his gambling was benign and that if he had been an alcoholic or a drug addict, baseball would have treated him compassionately instead of barring him for life. Rose has begun an aggressive campaign to be allowed to return to baseball and to gain entry to the Hall of Fame, finally admitting that he bet on games while managing the Cincinnati Reds. Meanwhile, two players who never let their drug and alcohol problems define them slipped into Hall of Fame jerseys at the Waldorf-Astoria yesterday.

VRanks of New York City police officers assigned to high-crime schools will expand by 150 in February; officers are considered problem solvers and role models as well as law officers; school assignment, once akin to professional banishment, is now something officers seek out; experts say sudden influx of officers presents opportunities for lasting changes, but there is risk that sutdents could perceive themselves as targets and become alienated; photo (M)

VLawyers for a convicted killer on death row are asking New York's highest court to make it harder for prosecutors to win death sentences, just as some prosecutors are growing impatient with the court, which has yet to approve a single execution. In written arguments in a death penalty case to be considered by the New York Court of Appeals on Wednesday, the state's Capital Defender Office argues for the first time that the state Constitution requires a special rule for death penalty cases. That rule would mean that to convict someone of capital murder, the standard of proof would be greater than ''beyond a reasonable doubt,'' the standard for conviction in criminal cases in this country for centuries.

VA raid on an abandoned brewery near the Ontario city of Barrie netted 30,000 marijuana plants in what the police said was the biggest growing operation ever found in Canada. The police said the factorylike operation used miles of irrigation piping and 1,000 hydroponic lights to nurture plants in an area of 60,000 square feet. Nine men were arrested. A police official said as many as 50 workers were living in dormitorylike rooms with refrigerators, stoves and televisions.

VJason Kidd is the Nets' franchise player and Kenyon Martin and Richard Jefferson are the complementary forwards, a triad around which the Nets have built back-to-back conference championships. A lesser-known starter is shooting guard Kerry Kittles, but as Kidd said after practice Monday: ''We go to the next level when Kerry plays well. It is like a sixth gear.'' In the last four games, Kittles has averaged 17.5 points, well above his season average of 12.7, and made nearly 54 percent of his shots. His teammates have noticed those statistics, especially the three victories, and they want Kittles to shoot more.

VTHE BEST AWFUL By Carrie Fisher 269 pages. Simon & Schuster. $24. MAGGIE DARLING A Novel By James Howard Kunstler 324 pages. Atlantic Monthly Press. $23. The meltdowns of recognizable public figures are fodder for two fizzy comic novels, each with a high-profile heroine. James Howard Kunstler's ''Maggie Darling'' conjures a certain well-known, tirelessly perfect domestic goddess, someone whose fans say things like: ''Love your balsamic duck. It's become my main company dish.'' She is the kind of woman who serves homemade bûche de Noël to the state troopers she has summoned to kick her husband out of their oft-photographed Connecticut home.

The reception for Kidd is sure to be much different from the last time he was in town. In July, he was treated to a free-agent recruiting bonanza, led by Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich, and chauffeured by the league's most valuable player, Tim Duncan.

VThe time was 1998, when Republicans were on the verge of impeaching President Bill Clinton. Howard Dean, then governor of Vermont, was unhappy with Mr. Clinton and disgusted with the Republican leadership in Washington. But he did find a Republican to admire. ''George W. Bush did very well,'' Dr. Dean said of the Texas governor, who had just been elected to a second term. ''Why? Because he is talking about his issues in a civil, thoughtful way in getting his point across.''

The accused were identified as Vincenzo A. Perricone, 25, of Burlington, and James H. Dowd, 27, of Lumberton, who are stationed at the Burlington County Jail. A grand jury indictment, handed up on Friday, accused Mr. Dowd of smuggling in marijuana, prepaid cellphones and alcohol. Mr. Perricone was accused of bringing in cigarettes in exchange for at least $200 in cash bribes, the criminal division said. Both men have been suspended. The indictment charged Mr. Dowd with bribery, official misconduct, and engaging in a pattern of official misconduct. There is no record of a lawyer for Mr. Dowd, and Mr. Perricone's lawyer did not return a call for comment. Stacy Albin (NYT)

VWhatever snowy winter grace that fluttered to earth had already deserted Sedgwick Avenue, where the sidewalk was a slippery gray washboard of ice and dirt. Six flights up, Pedro Pietri sat in a room where the hiss of a radiator gave way to warmer thoughts of the islands -- in his case, Manhattan and Puerto Rico. Those two places -- one within view across the 207th Street Bridge, the other just as vivid in his soul -- have been his touchstones as a poet chronicling the contradiction of tropical people living in urban wastelands.

VA marijuana-based medication for people suffering from multiple sclerosis and severe pain is expected to be approved for sale in Britain early this year, British officials say. The drug, Sativex, developed by GW Pharmaceuticals, a British company, is a liquid extract from marijuana grown by the company under license from the government. Developed to be sprayed under the tongue, it would be the first drug in recent decades to include all the components of the cannabis plant, advocates of medical marijuana say.

VIn one of the most frenzied weeks in franchise history, the Nets endured an ownership change, talk of relocation and a coaching change. It may have been too much for a troubled young player. Eddie Griffin told a Nets official here Wednesday morning that he was not ready to return to the N.B.A. and flew to his home in Houston to resume therapy. Griffin, who agreed to a contract with the Nets last month, spent much of November and December at the Menninger Clinic in Houston, undergoing treatment for depression and substance abuse.

VCasinos are canceling Super Bowl parties and giving refunds to thousands of people after the National Football League threatened legal action against some of the biggest hotels in Las Vegas. Several hotels received letters last week informing them that their parties were ''unauthorized use of N.F.L. intellectual property.'' Brian McCarthy, an N.F.L. spokesman, said the league recently became aware of large-scale parties planned in Las Vegas and elsewhere around the country.

VA man with a long criminal record was arrested on Saturday and charged with terrorizing the Upper East Side last week in a string of sexual assaults and robberies that victimized three women and a man, police officials said yesterday. The police arrested the man, Kevin White, 34, in Union City, N.J., after the victims identified him in a lineup. He was charged with three counts of sexual abuse, two counts of sodomy and four counts of robbery, among other charges, said Barbara Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney's office. The police have also charged Mr. White in connection with an Oct. 16 attack on a man in the East Village.

VIF anyone knows about second chances, or third or fourth ones, it is Julio Medina. He is a convicted drug dealer turned counselor and, recently, an invited guest in the gallery at President Bush's State of the Union address. As he talks about this latest episode in his life, Mr. Medina sits not so very still in the empty chapel of the Church of the Living Hope in East Harlem. The chapel is the only place in which this ebullient man, who speaks with hands slicing the air, can find some quiet, away from the busy hum of the floors above, where former inmates are learning about anger management and preparing résumés at his Exodus Transitional Community, a nonprofit organization that helps them get back on their feet. A professional media consultant in a tweed blazer waits discreetly in an upstairs office in case Mr. Medina, the group's executive director, should need him.

VGov. George E. Pataki on Monday used the capture of a career criminal, charged in a recent string of sexual assaults and robberies on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, to attack Democrats in the State Assembly for ignoring his bill to put those convicted of repeat misdemeanors in jail as felons. The governor, a Republican, noted the multiple arrests and convictions that the suspect, Kevin White, 34, had amassed over the past decade to make a point about the legislation Mr. Pataki proposed in 2000, which never passed in the Democratic-controlled Assembly.

VDouglas Faneuil, the former stockbroker's assistant who is the pivotal witness in the Martha Stewart trial, described an elaborate cover-up yesterday that began soon after he tipped Ms. Stewart over the telephone to sell her shares of ImClone Systems. It started, he said, with a claim that she made the trade to balance profits from other stock sales. That was soon substituted, Mr. Faneuil said, with another explanation: that she sold because of an existing agreement to do so if the share price fell below $60.

VSt. John's expelled one starting basketball player, moved to expel two others and disciplined three reserves last night. The actions came after an incident involving a 38-year-old Queens woman that began in a strip club in a Pittsburgh suburb. The woman was charged by the Pittsburgh police with lying about her claim that she had been raped by several St. John's players she met at the club. Although no players were charged, the university took action against the six players on a team suffering through one of the worst seasons in St. John's history.

VSt. John's administrators vowed yesterday that the men's basketball team would continue its season tomorrow with eight players in the wake of an incident that began at a Pittsburgh-area strip club, the latest black eye for a program that has had a swift fall from prominence to embarrassment. The events early Thursday, which included accusations of rape that were ultimately discounted by the police because of one player's video cellphone recording, led to swift discipline by St. John's on Thursday. One player was expelled, and two were in danger of expulsion; they are all starters. Three reserve players were suspended from the team.

VCHRISTIAN BALE looks good as Sam, a straight-arrow medical resident, and Kate Beckinsale is appealing as Alex, his scholarly fiancée, but LAUREL CANYON (2003) is Frances McDormand's movie. Ms. McDormand plays Sam's mother, a rich, vibrant old-hippie record producer who can often be found at her California home smoking marijuana with a group of young men (in the daytime!). When Sam and Alex move in with her temporarily, he's just embarrassed, but Alex, who probably needs a break from her dissertation on fruit flies anyway, is attracted to the constant pool-party atmosphere. Maybe Alex's conservative East Coast mother (Catherine McGoohan) was right when she teased Sam at the beginning of the film about their moving to California: ''We don't want her to join the Scientologists. Or the vegetarians.'' Lisa Cholodenko wrote and directed -- Friday at 12:05 p.m. on Cinemax. The hero of Ernst Lubitsch's musical gem THE SMILING LIEUTENANT (1931) is Lieutenant Niki (Maurice Chevalier), of the Austrian Royal Guard. He meets Franzi (Claudette Colbert), a cute beer-garden musician, and she moves in with him. One day he sees her across the way and winks, but the terribly unattractive Princess Anna (Miriam Hopkins) of Flausenshaum, passing by, thinks the wink is meant for her and insists that Niki marry her. He has no choice. But consummating the marriage is another thing, and he refuses because Anna is so frumpy. So Franzi, a generous girl, gives the princess a beauty makeover, to the tune of ''Jazz Up Your Lingerie.'' These pre-Code movies, made before Hays Office censorship, can be so naughty -- Saturday at 7:30 a.m. on TCM.

VThe Rev. Donald J. Harrington, the president of St. John's, said yesterday that an incident that began with some St. John's basketball players making a trip to a strip club was not an isolated problem and reflected an atmosphere that had developed around the team. Harrington, speaking publicly about the incident for the first time, absolved the team's interim coach, Kevin Clark, of responsibility for the actions of several players hours after St. John's game at Pittsburgh on Wednesday night. Harrington said that what he called the culture of the team developed long before Clark took over in December after Mike Jarvis was fired.

It is a place where incongruities are as plentiful as wheelchairs. The home, the A. Holly Patterson Extended Care Facility, has long been a last stop for indigent people, but former employees said it was once the Park Avenue of public nursing homes, a place where residents took trips to watch horse races at Belmont and to sail Long Island's South Shore.

VIt was perhaps not the first place one would have expected to find Senator Orrin G. Hatch, and yet there he was, not on Capitol Hill worrying about judicial nominations, but rather glad-handing with the likes of Sting and Geri Halliwell of the Spice Girls at EMI Music Publishing's swanky Grammy after-party in downtown Los Angeles. As waiters wielding trays of tuna tartare, crab rolls and caviar-filled minipotatoes scurried about the sprawling rooftop of the Los Angeles County Museum, Senator Hatch gleefully discussed music -- his music. ''I'm working on a patriotic album with some of Nashville's greatest producers,'' he said, hair combed into perfect submission, tuxedo pressed and gleaming. He has a Christmas album due out later this year and has written everything from country rousers to ballads. Senator Hatch, Republican of Utah, or dare we call him MC Hatch, has even tried his hand at rapping.

But a herd of 18 bongos now living at the base of Mount Kenya, Africa's second highest peak, has just completed the most circuitous of journeys, one that has taken them back to their ancestral home.

VThe singer Art Garfunkel, who was charged with unlawful possession of marijuana after state troopers stopped his limousine for speeding on Jan. 17, has pleaded guilty and paid $200 in fines, court officials in this town 55 miles southwest of Albany said yesterday. A trooper who stopped the car, in which Mr. Garfunkel was the sole passenger, said that he smelled marijuana as he approached the limousine, and that he found a bag containing six grams in the singer's jacket pocket. Mr. Garfunkel's lawyer was to appear in court yesterday, but entered the guilty plea last Wednesday.

VA man fell to his death on Wednesday afternoon while trying to evade the police by hanging off an East Harlem roof, a police spokesman said yesterday. Narcotics agents were executing a search warrant at 1799 Lexington Avenue when the man, Simon Ambrose, 31, of the Bronx, fled to the roof and tried to hang over the wall, but lost his grip and fell seven floors, the police said. The officers found marijuana and arrested three men, Lawrence Shields, 29, and Jason Romero, 22, of the Bronx, and Jimmy Rooks, 22, of West 109th Street in Manhattan. Shaila K. Dewan (NYT)

VThe government reintroduced a bill in the House of Commons to decriminalize use of small amounts of marijuana. Under the measure, anyone possessing under 15 grams -- about enough for 20 cigarettes -- would be fined rather than face criminal charges, much like receiving a traffic ticket. At the same time, the bill sets stricter penalties for marijuana producers. An earlier version died when Prime Minister Jean Chrétien retired in December and the Parliament session ended. The new law could pass as early as spring. Colin Campbell (NYT)

Both are graduates of St. John's University. Cuomo, the former New York governor, earned his bachelor's degree there in 1953 and also his law degree, in 1956, and Stanley, a sports management major, graduated last spring. Both know poverty. Cuomo, the youngest son of a greengrocer, lived in South Jamaica, Queens. Stanley, the only child of a single mother, lived in the Farragut Houses in Brooklyn.

VHIGHLIGHTS VAN GOGH OR NOT VAN GOGH? -- Is it or isn't it? That's the question swirling around the 19th-century photograph that is the focus of an exhibition running through March 4 in the Seton Gallery at the University of New Haven in West Haven, Conn. Is the photograph, above, the image of the mature Vincent van Gogh, who left behind 40 self-portraits but is believed to be the subject of only two photographs, taken when he was 13 and 19. Dating to the late 1880's, the pivotal photograph of the middle-aged man on view in West Haven was bought for $1 by an artist, Tom Stanford, who found it while combing through a stack of 19th-century photos at an antiques dealer's in 1990. It shows a bearded man with a long, sharp nose and a neat beard who is wearing a plain suit and a bow tie and certainly bears a strong resemblance to the van Gogh familiar from his paintings. Although the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam contests the conclusion that the man is van Gogh, David Skora, the director of the Seton Gallery, said the photograph was subjected to analysis by Joseph Buberger, a photo historian, and Dr. Albert Harper, director of the Henry C. Lee Institute of Forensic Science. He said both concluded that the image is that of van Gogh and that the person depicted in the two photographs believed to be those of the artist as a teenager is actually his brother, Theo. With reproductions of self-portrait paintings and drawings shown with permission of the Van Gogh Museum, ''Discovering van Gogh: A Forensic Study in Identification'' displays not only the photos and related art but explores forensic evaluation. NEW BENEFACTORS -- American Ballet Theater announced yesterday that it had attracted three new corporate sponsors and a challenge grant of $400,000. The troupe said Countrywide Financial Corporation, a major residential mortgage lending concern, and Cole Haan, the fashion and accessories company, had become sponsors of its national tour and New York seasons, and that Saks Fifth Avenue had become a sponsor of its costume fund. In addition, Joseph A. Wilson, a commercial real estate developer from New Jersey, has initiated the challenge grant to raise funds for Ballet Theater in the next two years. The grant will match new or increased donations up to $400,000, for a potential yield of $800,000; and if the challenge is met, Ballet Theater said, Mr. Wilson has made an additional commitment of $200,000 for 2006, raising the potential to $1.2 million.

VA federal judge in Brooklyn ruled yesterday that an F.B.I. agent made false statements in a sworn application for a search warrant in a drug paraphernalia case. The judge therefore barred prosecutors from using any of the evidence they found during the search. In the harshly worded decision, the judge, Nicholas G. Garaufis, said the agent, Elvin Quinones, ''recklessly, if not deliberately, disregarded the truth,'' and then gave confused and ''grossly false'' testimony when questioned about his earlier statements.

VFOR a place synonymous with music, Woodstock is eerily silent at night. The Tinker Street Cafe, where Bob Dylan composed two influential albums of the 1960's -- ''Another Side of Bob Dylan'' and ''Bringing It All Back Home'' -- is now a hushed photography gallery. The Bearsville Studios, where artists from the Band to Muddy Waters recorded albums, may soon become a private residence. And the Joyous Lake club, where Phish once threw surprise concerts, has been shut more than a year. But the music lives on in ways unexpectedly chic and quintessentially bohemian. Despite a popular image burnished by countless CD reissues and VH-1 retrospectives, Woodstock is no longer just a shrine for burned-out hippies who cling to the Woodstock festival of 1969 in the tradition of former high school quarterbacks reliving past glory.

VThe federal appeals court here has refused to reconsider its ruling that allows Californians to grow and use marijuana to treat their illnesses. The Bush administration had asked the court, for the Ninth Circuit, to hold a new hearing on that ruling, issued by a three-judge panel in December on a lawsuit filed by two women with chronic illnesses. But in an order issued Wednesday and made public on Thursday, the court denied the request.

It was unclear whether Stanley would play in the Red Storm's two remaining games, but the interim coach Kevin Clark said the matter would be reviewed some time this week, perhaps today.

VOn the presidential campaign trail, Representative Dennis J. Kucinich boasts that he is ''Cleveland's favorite son.'' But some who live in his district wonder whether this son has distanced himself too much from the hometown voters who have sent him to Congress four times. Mr. Kucinich, a former mayor, remains popular and is respected here for fighting the bread-and-butter fights of a congressman: defending steel jobs, rescuing public hospitals and rerouting train traffic. His district, the 10th, which stretches from west Cleveland into its suburbs, includes $800,000 lakefront homes and urban neighborhoods showing their age. The variety of its religious institutions -- Latvian Lutheran churches, Arab Baptist congregations and grand mosques -- testifies to the presence of immigrant families, old and new. And the Ford engine plant provides a clue to the strength of organized labor, which keeps the area solidly Democratic.

VGiants receiver David Tyree was charged with drug possession after he was stopped for speeding Tuesday night in Fort Lee, N.J., and more than a half-pound of marijuana was found in his car, the police said. Tyree, 24, was stopped on Interstate 95 after exiting from the George Washington Bridge. According to the police report, the police officer smelled marijuana in the car and questioned Tyree's two passengers, Al-Girard Taylor, 19, of Newark, and Justin Madera, 20, of Jersey City. All three were arrested and booked at the Bergen County Jail. Tyree was released yesterday after posting $2,500 bail.

VIn the 1960's, when French hippies were getting stoned and taking to the barricades, Lucien Pellat-Finet was living a life typical of those lucky enough to be born into the class known as grand bourgeois. A son of a wealthy family from Nice, Mr. Pellat-Finet was probably the last person one would have associated with any sort of counterculture. As a young man, he found himself drawn to fashion. He went to work for Georges Rech, Thierry Mugler and Chanel. He opened a Parisian boutique with a friend. He developed a reputation as a talented journeyman, known well enough but far from central to the scene. It was not until he was in his mid-40's that Mr. Pellat-Finet did what many in his generation had done decades earlier. He dropped out. With money from the sale of his shop, he bummed around the United States and Europe.

VDavid Crosby, the veteran rock musician who has long spoken of overcoming the drug abuse that led to his imprisonment and liver transplant, was arrested early yesterday in a Times Square hotel after an employee found marijuana, a loaded pistol and two knives in his bag, the police said. Mr. Crosby and the band he is touring with, CPR, had performed at the B.B. King Blues Club and Grill on 42nd Street on Thursday night, and in Wayne, N.J., on Friday night. He had checked out of his room at the Doubletree Suites hotel on Broadway, but left behind a suitcase, and an employee searching it for identification found about an ounce of marijuana, rolling papers, a hunting knife, a folding knife and a .45-caliber pistol, the police said.

VThe owner and two top executives of a popular Hell's Kitchen dance club were arrested yesterday in an early-morning raid at the club, which the authorities said was being run as a ''stash house'' where the use and sale of drugs were rampant. In a news conference yesterday afternoon, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, David N. Kelley, said that overdoses by patrons of the club, Sound Factory, on 46th Street near 12th Avenue, were commonplace and often concealed by management. Mr. Kelley said the club operated what amounted to a makeshift intensive care unit, a room known as crack alley, where bouncers tried to revive clubgoers who had overdosed, to avoid calling 911.

VA New York City police sergeant who shot two unarmed men fleeing an arrest in East Harlem on Monday night thought he saw one of the men reaching toward his waistband for a weapon, the police said yesterday. Devon Williams, 24, the man who the sergeant said appeared to be reaching, was struck in the left thigh and the arm, the police said, and the second man, Wayne Maxwell, 27, was grazed in the left hand. A pair of scissors and a cellphone were found near where the two men were struck, the police said.

V''Every car has its own story,'' said the officer standing outside the New York City Police Department's vehicle pound, in a bleak industrial zone in northern Queens. ''One car might have killed someone; another might have been stolen.'' The owners, mostly people whose cars were confiscated after they were arrested on drunken driving or other charges, have their stories too. And more of them have been showing up here since January, when the Police Department began trying to give back thousands of the cars. A federal judge ordered the department to hold hearings on the forfeitures more promptly. In the past, owners often had to wait months or years to get their cars back.

VWhen 16-year-old Samantha Dolan of Morristown died on Sunday morning, apparently of a drug overdose, her parents did something unusual. Instead of keeping quiet about the circumstances of her death, Lorraine and Patrick Dolan chose to speak out about how their daughter died, hoping to save other young people, they said. ''They want people to know that this can happen to anybody,'' said Marianne Dolan, Samantha's sister-in-law. ''It doesn't matter how good a family you are, how good a student your child is. It's not just one kind of child who is getting caught up in drugs anymore.''

VGiven that she had been thrown out of the house by 13 for declaring herself a lesbian, spent her teenage years sleeping on subway trains and rotting piers and yet still managed to get her G.E.D., Laura Melendez figured she had kept her nose pretty clean.

The muggings, assaults and drug overdoses have nearly disappeared, and you can now safely navigate the park day or night.

The $10 million plan, to be announced on Tuesday by the Department of Homeland Security, will include the first use of unmanned aircraft for border patrol, the addition of several hundred agents and the creation of seven tent complexes to detain illegal border crossers.

VImagine current pop turned inside out. Playing concerts would be a living rather than a promotional tool, bands would take musical chances nightly, wardrobe would be an afterthought, a group could release a dozen live albums a year, and gray hair and wrinkles would garner respect. Fans would bypass radio and television and get information from other fans (via the Internet), and music's past would be a foundation rather than a scrap heap. That is the realm of jam bands, who had their annual reckoning with the fourth Jammy Awards on Tuesday night at the Theater at Madison Square Garden, with dancers on their feet and marijuana smoke in the air. Jam bands bring music's ancient business model -- the roving troubadour -- to the interconnected modern world. While selling pop music on expensively produced and promoted CD's is a paradigm under siege, jam bands have flourished as concert mainstays and as an alternative to canned music.

VWhen the Portland Trail Blazers and then the Atlanta Hawks put Rasheed Wallace on an auction block before the trading deadline last month, nervous general managers and coaches around the N.B.A. assessed the risk to their reputations and the sanity of acquiring Wallace. They all knew about the disruptions on and off the court that Wallace had been involved in over seven and a half seasons in Portland. Wallace had turned down a contract extension offer from the Blazers and made it clear he was ready to leave; he could be a free agent at the end of the season. So the Blazers, frustrated and embarrassed by a variety of incidents in recent years, traded him to Atlanta, which had Wallace on the court for one game before sending him to the Detroit Pistons.

VLast fall, the Miller Place Union Free School District surveyed its 1,400 students in Grades 7 to 12 about their experiences with illegal drugs and weapons. When the results came back in January, the district zeroed in on one alarming finding. The questionnaire asked, ''While at school, have you carried a gun?'' Twenty-three students had said yes. Whether the students were taking advantage of the survey's cloak of anonymity to answer with frightening candor or to tell a prankish lie, district officials say the results affirmed their recent decision to have school buildings searched by dogs trained to sniff out hidden drugs and weapons.

VA 20-year-old man who won an $18 million lottery jackpot but was later convicted of possessing cocaine, marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms was ordered to undergo counselling and drug testing. The man, Michael Carroll, who was dubbed the ''Lotto Lout'' by the British tabloids when he showed up to collect his winnings wearing a court-issued electronic tag, has a long history of convictions for low-grade offenses, including drunk and disorderly behavior, falsely claiming unemployment benefits and failing to pay for train tickets. His lawyer attributed Mr. Carroll's drug use to the stress of winning the National Lottery in November 2002 and the subsequent breakdown of his marriage, and promised that Mr. Carroll would change his ways. As he left court, Mr. Carroll gestured obscenely at the waiting reporters. Sarah Lyall (NYT)

VMitchell Algus 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea Through April 3 If you could see into the murkier corners of the mind of the middle-aged antihero in ''Curb Your Enthusiasm,'' you might find images like the ones in Dennis Kardon's paintings. Having progressed from abstraction in the 1970's to hyperrealistic close-ups of body parts in the 1980's, Mr. Kardon has lately been making generously painterly, voluptuously creepy narrative pictures of familial conflict, sexual angst and infantile yearning in colors ranging from muddy to steamily glowing.

VMitchell Algus  511 West 25th Street, Chelsea  Through April 3      If you could see into the murkier corners of the mind of the middle-aged antihero in ''Curb Your Enthusiasm,'' you might find images like the ones in Dennis Kardon's paintings....

VREEFER MADNESS: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market, by Eric Schlosser. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.) The author of ''Fast Food Nation'' examines three facets of America's estimated $650 billion underground economy: the pornography industry, marijuana cultivation and the plight of illegal immigrants who harvest strawberries in California. His goal seems to be ''a refutation of Adam Smith's theory of the modern market economy,'' Sam Sifton wrote in these pages in 2003. ''Schlosser is a fine and diligent reporter with a real gift for description, and his three dispatches are fascinating pieces of work.'' REGARDING THE PAIN OF OTHERS, by Susan Sontag. (Picador, $11.) In her long, provocative essay on the photographic representation of suffering and cruelty, from the Civil War to the Nazi death camps, from Bosnia to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Sontag reflects on how we process such images, the limits of shock and the motives of those behind the cameras. The result is a ''coruscating sermon,'' John Leonard said here last year. ''She knows lots of things the rest of us only wish we did.'' THE HEALING LAND: The Bushmen and the Kalahari Desert, by Rupert Isaacson. (Grove, $13.) The Bushmen of the Kalahari in southern Africa have one of the oldest human cultures, and the author recounts their history, rituals and struggle for survival, including their drunken, violent life in exile from their homeland. The Bushmen ''have long deserved the attentions of a levelheaded writer who wouldn't simplify their magic and ruination into a sentimental legend,'' Michael Pye said here last year. SONS OF MISSISSIPPI: A Story of Race and Its Legacy, by Paul Hendrickson. (Vintage, $15.) Winner of a National Book Critics Circle award, this account centers on a 1962 Life magazine photograph of seven lawmen whooping it up just before the fiery riot started by whites trying to block James Meredith from enrolling in the University of Mississippi. Last year our reviewer, Brent Staples, was unpersuaded by the author's attempt to bring these stonelike figures to life and to provide context for racist attitudes in the South. On the contrary, he wrote, ''what 'Sons of Mississippi' teaches more than anything else is that stereotypes are real.'' THE NERVE, by Glyn Maxwell. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.) These low-key poems, which never wander far from the English verse tradition, employ a conversational or faux-naïf voice as they explore subjects like the Leonid meteor showers or a roadside fair and move confidently toward expressions of common feeling. ''Maxwell is an intelligent and sensitive writer,'' David Orr wrote here in 2002, and '' 'The Nerve' is one of the most enjoyable books of this year.'' Knopf has reissued two posthumously published collections of Kenneth Koch's verse, Sun Out: Selected Poems, 1952-1954 and A Possible World: Poems (each $15). ''Both are exuberant records of a life well lived in both seriousness and humor,'' Melanie Rehak said in these pages in 2002. ''Whether Koch is remembering himself in youth . . . or traveling in Thailand, he is aware of and awestruck by the immensity of experience and his own endless hunger for more.'' A MEMORY OF WAR, by Frederick Busch. (Ballantine, $14.95.) In this talk-filled novel, a Manhattan psychologist is confronted by a patient who claims to be his half brother, saying that during World War II their Jewish mother had an affair with a German SS interpreter who was a prisoner of war in England. That unsettling contention raises many questions for the psychologist and sets off a crisis in his already complicated inner life. Last year in the Book Review, Bruce Bawer admired the tale's ''genuineness of feeling'' and ''breadth of ambition.'' SOLITAIRE, by Kelley Eskridge. (Eos/HarperCollins, $13.95.) Even though its plotting is a bit far-fetched, this 2002 science-fiction thriller about a privileged young woman sentenced to eight years of high-tech ''virtual confinement'' inside her own head impressed our reviewer, Gerald Jonas. ''Eskridge's evocation'' of her ordeal ''is a stylistic and psychological tour de force,'' he wrote. ''The horrors she confronts, the defenses she mounts, the things she learns are treated with a painful but bracing clarity.'' Scott Veale

VOnly one team battling for an Eastern Conference playoff spot is showing this postseason chase the respect it deserves: the Miami Heat. Cleveland has fallen back into the funk that engulfed it for much of the season. The ailing Knicks appear capable of beating only teams that are lousy or ravaged by injury. Milwaukee has succumbed to a tough schedule, and Boston, Toronto and Philadelphia are doing what clubs of their caliber do: winning two of every five games.

VThe Supreme Court ruled unanimously on Tuesday that release of the death-scene photographs of Vincent W. Foster, the Clinton administration's deputy White House counsel who killed himself in 1993, would be an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of Mr. Foster's surviving family members. The court said the photographs should be shielded from disclosure in a suit brought under the Freedom of Information Act by a California lawyer, Alan J. Favish, who said he doubted the conclusion reached in five separate investigations that Mr. Foster committed suicide.

VSINCE the Middle Ages, brewers have flavored beer by adding the fragrant flowers of the hop vine (Humulus lupulus) to a boiling barley mash. A new device now lets barkeeps in on the action, allowing them to charge their beer with an extra dose of flavor at the moment the tap is pulled. The Organoleptic Hops Transducer, as its inventor, Sam Calagione, calls it, is an industrial-grade water filter, three feet long, that can be packed with a pound of fresh hops and attached to a draft beer line between the keg and the tap.

VDirected by Kevin Bray PG-13, 86 minutes The latest messiah of the multiplex is Chris Vaughn, the character played by the former professional wrestler the Rock in ''Walking Tall,'' which opens today nationwide. Crisply directed by Kevin Bray, this film is a remake of the Nixon-era law-and-order hit of the same title, which was set in a Tennessee town taken over by vice peddlers, and starred Joe Don Baker as Sheriff Buford Pusser, a no-nonsense guy who cleaned up the streets with the help of a huge wooden club.

VMARIJUANA use is on the rise again on Long Island. After decades as the recreational drug of choice for the young, hip and rebellious, marijuana appeared to go out of fashion about 15 to 20 years ago, at least to judge by law enforcement statistics. The number of arrests in Nassau County for marijuana possession or sale fell from 864 in 1985 to 468 in 1990 as pot smoking was largely supplanted by crack cocaine and synthetic party drugs like angel dust and Ecstasy.

VTwo of the singers whose albums are reviewed here have spent time in jail. The third was forced into exile until the overthrow of the colonial regime he opposed. Their voices can sound scarred and mournful, but their music is just as likely to head for the dance floor, where warnings, protests and messages of compassion can draw hope from the beat. 'Kaxexe' Bonga As an exile and expatriate, Bonga Kwenda became the musical conscience of Angola, with a pained, husky voice that seems to hold all the troubles of his homeland.

VThe Supreme Court agreed on Monday to decide whether the police need a special reason to subject a car they have stopped for a traffic violation to a drug-sniffing dog. The case is an appeal by the State of Illinois from a ruling by the Illinois Supreme Court. That court found last year by a vote of 4 to 3 that use of a drug-sniffing dog, without any particular reason to suspect that the car contained drugs, had unconstitutionally broadened the scope of a routine traffic stop. In this case, the dog alerted the police to a large quantity of marijuana in the trunk.

On Tuesday, Lenox Davis, 42, of Hawthorne, Calif., and Gilbert Francis, 41, of Los Angeles, driving a truck owned by Commercial Renaissance of Sacramento, were arrested on charges of possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute, according to the state police. Investigators boarded the truck and found 16 cardboard boxes with 690 pounds of marijuana concealed in the shipment, law enforcement officials said. The two men are being held in the Union County Jail on $1 million bail. Janon Fisher (NYT)

For seven and a half years, he has watched sleepy state roads and bustling highways for speeding commuters and careless drivers. Now he also serves as a foot soldier in the domestic war on terrorism, one of a small but growing number of police officers empowered by the Department of Homeland Security to arrest and detain illegal immigrants.

His hiring, under a five-year contract, filled a job that had been vacant since Mike Jarvis was fired nearly five months ago. It also concluded several fractious weeks of lobbying among factions of alumni who backed different candidates.

That they opened the same day was certainly a coincidence. But was it a coincidence that the owners of both shops had previously worked at Magnolia Bakery?

VBoys who had trouble sleeping as toddlers are more likely to become early users of alcohol and marijuana than those who slept well, a new study reports. The lead researcher of the study, Dr. Maria M. Wong of the University of Michigan, said that a link between insomnia and drug and alcohol abuse had already been found in adults but that the link had barely been explored earlier in life. Her study, published on Wednesday in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, drew on data from a long-running project that tracked 155 sons of alcoholics and 102 boys who were not children of alcoholics as a comparison group. Dr. Wong compared mothers' ratings of sleep problems at ages 3 to 5 with the boys' reports of drug, alcohol and cigarette use at ages 12 to 14. She found that in each group the boys who had trouble sleeping were more than twice as likely to have tried alcohol or marijuana by early adolescence than those who did not. Over all, half of those with sleep problems started using alcohol early.

The decision, by Judge Jeremy Fogel of Federal District Court in San Jose, was the first interpretation of an appeals court's ruling in December that federal prosecutions of medical marijuana users were unconstitutional if the marijuana was not sold, transported across state lines or used for nonmedicinal purposes.

Then there's the rapper Lil' Kim, who modeled for her cover in a minidress zipped down to her navel, her Mercedes-Benz G500 peeking through in the background. The magazine in question isn't Rolling Stone, People or even Maxim. It's Dub, a niche car magazine with a tiny paid circulation that has nevertheless become the bible of the urban automotive subculture devoted to 20-inch-plus spinners -- the outrageously flashy oversize wheels that pop up in nearly every MTV rap video -- and the hip-hop attitude they connote.

Now, the authorities are investigating whether their deaths this week were connected to that threat. Mr. Myles and Ms. Wheeler were shot and killed shortly before 1 a.m. Wednesday in the house where they rented basement apartments in St. Albans, Queens, the police said.

VThe law-enforcement authorities you quote in ''Police Fight Resurgent Marijuana Trade'' [April 4] are shell-shocked soldiers who have failed to realize that they are fighting the last war on drugs -- and have already lost. They bleat forlornly of their need for more money and more power to solve a nonexistent problem. They lie with statistics to paint a puffed-up picture of pot potency. High-THC varieties of cannabis (hashish and hash oil, for example) have been around for millennia. Its consumers are minimizing their exposure to tars and other harmful compounds by smoking less. And the statistics are highly unreliable, due to comparisons with high volumes of low potency Mexican marijuana from the 1970's and the vast increase of sample size and variety in the 80's.

VStarting in the fall, pharmacies in British Columbia will sell marijuana for medicinal purposes, without a prescription, under a pilot project devised by Canada's national health service. The plan follows a 2002 report by a Canadian Senate committee that found there were ''clear, though not definitive'' benefits for using marijuana in the treatment of chronic pain, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and other ailments. Both Prime Minister Paul Martin and Stephen Harper, leader of the opposition conservatives, support the decriminalization of marijuana. Oddly, the strongest criticism of the Canadian proposal has come from patients already using medical marijuana who think the government, which charges about $110 an ounce, supplies lousy pot. ''It is of incredibly poor quality,'' said one patient. Another said, ''It tastes like lumber.'' A spokesman for Health Canada promised the agency would try to offer a better grade of product.

The student, Julia Diaco, 18, of Rumson, N.J., sold marijuana, psychedelic mushrooms, acid, ecstasy and cocaine to undercover detectives on at least eight occasions in her dormitory, Hayden Hall, and at other West Village locations, said Lt. Phillip A. Spinella of the Manhattan South Narcotics Bureau said. The sales ranged from $60 to $650, he said. ''It's an area where we have a lot of problems, it's a high-profile area,'' he said.

A willowy woman equipped with a cane totters home with a small bag of frozen meals and a gossip magazine. A visiting attendant watches betrayal on the soaps with a woman in a wheelchair. At the senior center, two men work at a measured game of pool, a whoop rising as the nine ball dives into the corner pocket. But there is another side to life at Harborview Terrace, a much darker, threatening side that has transformed the daily cycles of many residents into a grotesque urban nightmare.

VTo the Editor: Although Eric Schlosser (Op-Ed, April 26) makes a valid point that medical marijuana should be made available to anyone with chronic pain, epilepsy and so on, his plea to decriminalize marijuana is dangerous and shortsighted. As Mr. Schlosser clearly states, ''marijuana is a powerful, mind-altering drug.''

VTo the Editor: Re ''Make Peace With Pot,'' by Eric Schlosser (Op-Ed, April 26): Too much money and time are being invested in the ''war'' against drugs, with little to show for it. All of the arrests and imprisonments are not stopping the epidemic, nor is our current system preventing children from acquiring and using marijuana. The mere ''dealing'' itself has become a problem of its own. This black market allows kids to make more money than if they got a high school or college degree.

VTo the Editor: The argument for legalizing marijuana (Op-Ed, April 26) falls apart when one considers the impact on teenagers and children. If society gives marijuana a green light, more kids will use and abuse the drug. The majority of teenagers entering drug treatment programs list marijuana as their primary drug of abuse. For those who've used marijuana without consequence, this may be hard to believe. But for thousands of kids, marijuana is not harmless.

VTo the Editor: Eric Schlosser's freedom to publicly criticize the government's war on marijuana is at the core of the constitutional protection of free speech. Unfortunately, thoughtful critiques such as his may soon be effectively outlawed in many public places. On Wednesday, a federal court in Washington heard a challenge to a law that cancels all federal financing to transit authorities that display ads promoting reform of marijuana laws. Evidently, criticisms of marijuana policy are so threatening to the government that it has resorted to enacting laws that blatantly trample our First Amendment rights.

VAs investigators search for a possible link between benefits given to Gov. John G. Rowland and the awarding of state contracts, the Connecticut General Assembly ended its session early Thursday by passing legislation that altered gift-disclosure rules for contractors who seek state work. As of Oct. 1, when the new law takes effect, contractors seeking state work must either swear they have not given gifts to a public official or state employee for two years or disclose any gifts made within that period.

VCRABS in a barrel. The phrase may be unfamiliar, but the image is clear: A determined swarm claws its way up an unclimbable expanse, each one scrabbling for something to grab hold of, until chaos swirls the entire mob back to its snarled starting point. Welcome to the Essex County rap scene, 2004. Here, spread across some of the most fertile rhyming grounds in hip-hop history -- gold- and platinum-selling artists like Queen Latifah, the Fugees (with Lauryn Hill) and Naughty by Nature got their starts in Newark and East Orange in the 1980's -- stands an army of such scrappers, each one ready for his or her shot at Jay-Z-caliber stardom or, at the very least, a turn at the mike.

VWITH me being a parent and assorted local high schools about to hold their graduations, it seems distantly possible that I will be asked to give a commencement address at one or another on that all-important day. The schools like to select parents with significant records of accomplishment who are held in high regard by the community and have served with distinction in it. However, sometimes those people aren't available, and a call goes out for anyone who can write quickly and owns a relatively new suit. I've been trying to prepare for such an emergency by sketching out a few remarks so I have them at the ready should the phone ring. Not that it matters much. I find that although my own high school graduation was only a few years ago, during the Nixon administration, I am unable to remember who my commencement speaker was or what he or she said. I also draw a blank on the identity of my college graduation speaker, although that may be because I didn't actually attend the ceremony.

VINTERPRETATIONS vary as to whether Lynette (Squeaky) Fromme (rhymes with homey) intended to kill President Gerald Ford when she aimed her gun at him on Sept. 5, 1975, in Sacramento; the chamber of the .45 Colt was empty. But her larger motivation was clear. Ms. Fromme has said -- and in his libretto for ''Assassins,'' the musical he wrote with Stephen Sondheim, John Weidman has reiterated -- that she committed the crime so that Charles Manson, whose ''family'' she had joined in 1967, would appear as a witness at her trial, and thus have a worldwide platform from which to preach his apocalyptic vision. Despite touring as a child in California with a dance group called the Westchester Lariats (they twice performed at the White House), Ms. Fromme's own family life had not been pleasant; her father, an aeronautical engineer, was by all accounts rough and tyrannical. It was after an argument with him that she met Mr. Manson on a Venice, Calif., beach. Soon she moved to Stockton, where she and several other Manson adherents set up a communal home. Though considered the alpha female of the group, Ms. Fromme was never convicted of participation in the infamous Tate-LaBianca murders that Mr. Manson directed on Aug. 9 and 10, 1969, nor in the mysterious deaths of two ''family'' members in 1972. But the assassination attempt on Mr. Ford, and her subsequent prison career, suggest that she has not repudiated her past. In 1979, she attacked a fellow inmate with the claw end of a hammer; in 1987, she escaped from a prison in West Virginia in hopes of meeting Mr. Manson again. (She was quickly recaptured.) At 55, she is now serving time at the Carswell Federal Medical Center in Fort Worth; though eligible for parole since 1985, she has consistently waived her right to a hearing.

VA trip to Vancouver, a sparkling city of glass and steel edged with snowcapped mountains, blends international chic with rugged Pacific Northwest grandeur. You won't feel out of place dressed to the nines, nibbling haute cuisine, but the region's jaw-dropping topography adds an earthy undertone. Bustling high style is tempered by courtesy and reserve. Driving in Vancouver can be frenetic and exasperating, but no one honks. In the past decade, with a flood of immigrants from Hong Kong, Vancouver has seen a sea change in its population. After English, Chinese is the second most-widely spoken language, Chinatown is vast and Asian restaurants of every kind dot many neighborhoods.

VI am a former federal prosecutor who has investigated and prosecuted narcotics traffickers. A few of my friends smoke marijuana and use other recreational drugs, and I have no problem tolerating that. But would it be unethical of me to use such drugs myself, having helped imprison drug offenders? I find it difficult to articulate what I find unethical here, apart from the illegality and feelings of hypocrisy. Anonymous, California A chain-smoking family doctor is a hypocrite: she advises patients to act one way while she acts another. An ethics columnist who preaches moderation but acts licentiously is a hypocrite, too. But the failure to practice what you preach doesn't necessarily reveal a lack of ethics, just a lack of character. Both the hypothetical doctor and the entirely imaginary columnist know that their advice is good; they simply lack the strength to follow it themselves.

VEach day this spring, Josh Evans left the Jets' weight room and went to an office upstairs. There, he flipped on a computer and studied the snippets of film of the nation's best college football players, diligently noting the skills of the defensive linemen he watched. In the darkened room, Evans, a defensive tackle for the Jets, began to erect a wall between himself and his pockmarked past. This is the first off-season since 1999 that Evans's mind has been clear enough to participate fully in a workout program and to concentrate on the small details of a job like the internship in the Jets' scouting department.

VA federal appeals court yesterday upheld the only law in the nation authorizing doctors to help their terminally ill patients commit suicide. The decision, by a divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, said the Justice Department did not have the power to punish the doctors involved. The majority used unusually pointed language to rebuke Attorney General John Ashcroft, saying he had overstepped his authority in trying to block enforcement of the state law, Oregon's Death With Dignity Act.

VFederal appeals court upholds only law in nation authorizing doctors to help their terminally ill patients commit suicide, saying Atty Gen John Ashcroft overstepped his authority in trying to block Oregon's Death With Dignity Act; Judge Richard C Tallman, writing for majority on divided three-judge panel, rebukes Ashcroft for his 'unilateral attempt to regulate general medical practices historically entrusted to state lawmakers'; emphasizes that court is not deciding morality or appropriateness of assisted suicide, just 'who gets to decide'; Justice Dept spokesman says lawyers there have not decided whether to ask 11-member panel of appeals court to rehear case or try to appeal to United States Supreme Court; Oregon's assisted-suicide law is product of 1994 voter initiative, allowing adults with incurable diseases who are likely to die in six months to obtain lethal drugs from their doctors; doctors may prescribe but not administer drugs, and they are granted immunity from liability; about 30 people a year have used law to end their lives since it became effective in 1997 (M)

VOn Thursday evening the Great Lawn in Central Park was the site of a showdown that had been anticipated for months: High Times vs. The Onion. No, it wasn't to debate whether readers are more interested in irony or intoxication. Instead, a different sort of bragging right was at stake, one that was to be decided on the softball diamond. And for those who pay close attention to the softball standings of local magazines and newspapers, the opening pitch of Thursday's game on Field 6 had the drama of an October night at Yankee Stadium. From 1996 through 2003 the High Times softball team has been the best team in what is informally called the magazine league. Going into Thursday's game, High Times had an unbeaten streak of 19 games going back to last season. The only team that High Times did not beat during that stretch was The Onion, which held on for a tie when the teams met last season.

V'Give Jamaica time . . . you'll see,'' lilts the reggae-infused airline jingle, singing the praises of the sultry Caribbean island to tourists. So how does, say, 2:30 a.m. sound? That's about the hour when ''passa-passa'' -- a decidedly untouristy street party in West Kingston -- is just getting going. Currently the talk of international music circles as the pilgrimage du jour, it builds to its climax around 7:30 a.m., sometimes including as many as 20,000 revelers.

VOn the February morning after he scored 47 points for Eastern Alamance High School, adding to his record as the highest-scoring prep basketball player in North Carolina state history, JamesOn Curry was called to the principal's office, where sheriff's deputies placed him and several other students in handcuffs and took them away. John Moon was teaching a world history class when he was told of the arrest. ''This was unbelievable,'' Moon, the boys' basketball coach, said. ''Nobody saw this coming. I mean, JamesOn was one of the finest young people I'd ever known. We were so close for all four of his years at Eastern Alamance. If I had a son, I would have wanted him to be JamesOn.

VJudge Gerald W. Hardcastle is a community pillar, an upright, modest man. He is a family court judge, the final arbiter for children who are neglected or abused, addicted or delinquent, lost to their parents or heading there. An endless stream of teenagers passes through the judge's courtroom, all with the same glum 10-mile stare. The judge will dispense decisions in 100 lives before lunch. He will do this with a brisk efficiency that is not the same as coldness. Sometimes, looking down at the pitiful one before him, the judge will be struck with an almost overwhelming sense of melancholy.

VFor ages, it seemed, teenagers drank and partied with impunity in the neat split-levels and imposing colonials scattered across Westchester County. A passing police cruiser occasionally sent partygoers fleeing, but mostly the keg bashes sputtered to a close, leaving in their wake a handful of excruciating hangovers and a few trampled beds of impatiens. But those days appear to be numbered. In the past few years, police departments in the county, working with the Westchester district attorney's office, have tackled the problem of under-age drinking in new and aggressive ways.

VA federal law that penalizes mass transit systems for accepting advertisements promoting the legalization or medical use of illegal drugs is unconstitutional, a federal district judge ruled. The law, which became effective in February, was challenged by groups seeking to buy space in subway stations and bus shelters for an ad titled ''Marijuana Laws Waste Billions of Taxpayer Dollars to Lock Up Non-Violent Americans.'' The judge, Paul L. Friedman, ruled that the law violates the First Amendment. Adam Liptak (NYT)

VRonald Wilson Reagan, a former film star who became America's 40th president, the oldest to enter the White House but imbued with a youthful optimism rooted in the traditional virtues of a bygone era, died yesterday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 93. To a nation hungry for a hero, a nation battered by Vietnam, damaged by Watergate and humiliated by the taking of hostages in Iran, Ronald Reagan held out the promise of a return to greatness, the promise that America would ''stand tall'' again.

VA judge ordered a defendant to leave a Queens courtroom through a side door yesterday so he could elude a detective waiting in a hallway to arrest him in a separate robbery case, the police said. The judge's action prompted the police commissioner to call for a judicial misconduct investigation. The defendant, Derek Sterling, was appearing before the judge, Justice Laura D. Blackburne of State Supreme Court in Queens, for a routine update about his progress in a drug treatment program that he had been sent to after a drug arrest. Justice Blackburne was apparently irritated with the detective's arrival at her courtroom and accused him in the record of misrepresenting himself.

VLt. Cmdr. Charles Swift received his first lesson in the misuse of power in 1980, when he was a plebe at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. Subjected to one indignation after another at the hands of upperclassmen, he came to realize that those who meted out the most vicious abuse were often the ones who had, in their day, been singled out themselves for especially harsh treatment. ''For them, the system was about getting even -- 'I can't punish the ones who did this to me, but I can punish you' -- and that bothered me,'' Swift says. ''I vowed that I would never do it to anyone else, and when I was an upperclassman, I tried to stop it.''

V''ONE-WAY TICKET TO HELL,'' the deliberately distasteful musical now receiving its world premiere from the 12 Miles West theater company, is on dangerous ground even before it begins, and knows it. A poster in the lobby jokingly apologizes to various ethnic and other groups likely to be offended by the show. More dangerous, though, in terms of theatrical risk, is the underlying idea of the play: to take a dreadful movie from long ago and parody it. The danger is twofold: the gimmick is becoming a bit familiar, and there are inherent problems in parodying something that practically no one in the audience has seen.

VIn August 1989, Daniel Rakowitz, 28, a self-styled marijuana guru living in the East Village, killed his girlfriend, 26-year-old Monika Beerle, by striking her in the throat. After hauling her corpse into a claw-foot bath tub, he dismembered her and stored her bones in a locker in Hell's Kitchen. Later, as rumors of the killing swirled through the neighborhood, he was said to have cooked her remains into a soup that he served to the homeless inhabitants of nearby Tompkins Square Park.

VDistrict Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau, left, announced his support yesterday for the medical use of marijuana during an unusual news conference with the talk-show host Montel Williams. They joined forces to support legislation in the State Assembly that would legalize the use of marijuana for the treatment of illnesses. Ten states allow such use now. ''Morphine, codeine and other controlled substances have been available for years to those who are in pain and for other medical purposes,'' said Mr. Morgenthau. ''Medical marijuana should join the list of carefully monitored drugs that should be made available to those in need.'' Mr. Williams, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, was overcome with emotion as he described the severe pain for which he uses legally prescribed marijuana, saying, ''There are times I can barely put my feet on the floor.'' Mr. Morgenthau said he had been swayed in part by one of his daughters, a medical doctor at a drug treatment program in a hospital in the city, who approves of medical marijuana. Asked by a reporter if he had ever used marijuana himself, Mr. Morgenthau, 84, blushed. After howls of laughter died down, Mr. Morgenthau smiled and said, ''I missed that generation.''

VIT has been 25 years since the first rap records were released, and as rap and hip-hop culture approach middle age, rhymes, beats, dance steps and graffiti are still being created on the street. But they have now been around for so long that they are also being discussed and dissected in the ivory tower. Hip-hop has also been the subject of museum exhibits, and for the last decade, artists, industry executives and collectors have announced plans to create a hip-hop hall of fame or museum, though such a thing has yet to materialize.

VOpiates remain the biggest drug problem because of booming production in Afghanistan, but control efforts in Colombia have sharply reduced consumption of cocaine, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reported. Overall, ''the spread of drugs in the world has slowed down,'' the report said. About 185 million people used illicit drugs worldwide in 2003, mostly marijuana, but ''global cocaine production is now at its lowest levels since the late 80's,'' Sandeep Chawla, chief of policy analysis and research at the drug office, said at a news conference. In 2003 in the United States, the world's largest market for cocaine, consumption fell by 23 percent from 1999 and more than 60 percent from 1985.

'' Mr. Bailey said as he crossed Green Park, where sunbathers were lolling in the grass and the smell of marijuana floated in the air. ''I mean, it's the weirdest question. What is that?'' He frowned. ''It's one person that you pick out from a crowd who's supposed to signify everything that for you is changing in the world. It's impossible. But a lot of people don't want to hear that.

In the end, only the Conservative leader, Stephen Harper, agreed to throw, and his off-speed pitch over the plate rewarded him with front-page photographs making him look robust only days before the June 28 parliamentary election.

VFor those no longer intrigued by magazine covers that promise to reveal ''3 Things That All Guys Crave in Bed'' or ''50 Ways to Lose the Weight,'' High Times magazine has a new tease: ''How to Get Arrested.'' But High Times, a magazine largely known for its adoring centerfold photo spreads of marijuana, is not talking about getting busted for possession of illegal drugs. The arresting cover line appears on the latest issue, an activist's guide to the Republican National Convention in New York, Aug. 30 through Sept. 2.

VJeff Bridges is changing his clothes in the green room of the ''Tavis Smiley Show.'' He is shedding his casual Santa Barbara persona -- white Mexican shirt, gray linen slacks and loafers -- for a leading man look: elegant black shirt, gray suit and suede shoes. He is in Hollywood to promote ''The Door in the Floor,'' Tod Williams's $7 million film adaptation of the 1998 John Irving novel, ''A Widow for One Year,'' co-starring Kim Basinger. He plays a children's book author, a blond, bearded, charismatic, womanizing narcissist whose estranged wife is still grief-stricken after the death of their two sons in a car accident. Early reviews of the film, which opens on July 14, positioned as relief for audiences sated by big action films, suggest it is the best role the actor has had in years. There is even some Oscar buzz about Mr. Bridges, 54, who has had three nominations for supporting roles and one for best actor in 1984 for ''Starman.'' This week he will finish filming ''The Moguls'' an $8 million indie gamble he calls ''a sweet Frank Capra-does-porn story.''

VThe Supreme Court agreed on Monday to decide whether Congress has the authority to prohibit the medical use of marijuana in states where the voters or the legislature have approved the drug's use under a doctor's care. The case, certain to be one of the most closely watched of the court's next term, is an appeal by the Bush administration of a preliminary ruling issued last December by the federal appeals court in San Francisco. That court, finding that the federal Controlled Substances Act was ''likely unconstitutional'' as applied to two California patients and their suppliers of marijuana, issued an injunction that barred federal enforcement while the case proceeded.

VA rap singer and a tap dancer were arrested on misdemeanor charges in two separate incidents yesterday, after police officers pulled them over for driving violations, the police said. Ja Rule, a rapper whose real name is Jeffrey Atkins, was swerving in and out of lanes on Avenue of the Americas just south of Houston Street in his 2001 Mercedes when the police stopped him about 2:15 a.m., they said. The police said they found that Mr. Atkins, who is originally from Hollis, Queens, was driving with a suspended license and had a small amount of marijuana in his car. At 1:10 p.m., Savion Glover, the tap dancer, was arrested on Houston Street near Avenue D in his 1997 BMW, after making three lane changes without signaling, the police said. Mr. Glover was also driving with a suspended license and had some marijuana, the police said. Sabrina Tavernise (NYT)

VMinutes before their game against Sol de América, members of the Independientes, an over-40 soccer team, dispersed to relieve themselves in a patch of woods behind the field. This was no ritual marking of territory, but, they said, an unavoidable consequence of playing weekend soccer at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens. ''Unfortunately, it's necessary,'' said Arnoldo Perez, a team member, as he emerged from behind a tree. ''We're lacking bathrooms.'' It is a common complaint here. Every weekend, as soccer fields that seem to stretch to the horizon fill with players and fans, the bushes and trees become, essentially, a mass restroom. There are precious few bathrooms in the 1,255-acre park, users contend, and some, like the facilities in the Queens Theater, are restricted to patrons only. Others are far away, ''like a two-day walk,'' said Federico Alzate, who lives in Flushing.

VThe guy is just another tourist. Or that's how it appears, anyway, to Cristina, the prim Portuguese woman holding down the front desk at the Residencia Roma, a spartan three-star hotel on a quiet side street in Lisbon. No two tourists are the same, of course, but there is something familiar, even iconic, in this man's eager-beaver smile, his unstylish windbreaker and leather walking shoes, his broken-spined guidebook to Spain and Portugal. Like most Americans, he doesn't pretend to speak anything but English. He inquires about rates -- 60 euros for a double -- then asks to see a room. Cristina shrugs, hands the man a key and waves him toward a set of stairs leading up into the hotel's interior, unaware that she has just set a dervish loose in her establishment. Safely beyond her gaze, Rick Steves accelerates up the stairs and rockets down a dim hallway, quickly shedding all pretense of leisure. This is what he calls a ''blitz,'' a 10-minute undercover rampage during which he will poke mattresses and inspect toilet seats, prowling the hotel like an unleashed hound. Earlier in the day, as we ate breakfast together, Steves had spelled out his plan for seeing Lisbon. ''We'll just blitz the Bairro Alto and the castle, then the restaurants,'' he said, spooning yogurt into his mouth at double the pace most of us think of as normal. ''And after that, we'll blitz the museums.'' With this, he peered under the breakfast table at my feet, adding, ''I hope those shoes are comfortable.''

VTHE worn, crumbling streets on the edge of downtown Newark would dissuade many from entertaining any thoughts of visiting, much less living there. But Heidi Postlewait sees those blocks as a lure, a Garden of Eden compared with some of her previous addresses. ''Newark is really fascinating,'' Ms. Postlewait said recently after scouring the area for the perfect home. ''I always thought about places forlorn and abandoned and bringing them back to their former glory.''

VThe rock musician David Crosby pleaded guilty in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan on Friday to attempted criminal possession of a weapon, a charge brought in March after a loaded pistol and a small amount of marijuana were found in his Times Square hotel room. Mr. Crosby, 62, a founding member of the Byrds and Crosby, Stills and Nash, was fined $5,000, said Sherry Hunter, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau. A charge of unlawful possession of marijuana was dismissed, she said, and prosecutors did not seek a more severe penalty on the weapons charge because the pistol was registered in California and was stowed safely in his luggage when it was found.

VThe girl was born while her mother was serving time in a Colorado prison, a woman who had been sentenced to three years for transporting marijuana. She was named Tyisha because her mother liked the sound of it. But no one knew the last name of Tyisha's father, so another man's name was chosen. That was the start of Tyisha McCoy's life. It ended on Thursday, when Tyisha, 13, was bound, gagged and strangled with a telephone cord in the Harlem apartment where she had lived with her legal guardian for two years. The home had been ransacked, the police say, and about $3,000 in jewelry was missing. But there was no sign of forced entry, and the police have named no suspects.

VTHE actor and playwright Tyler Perry had barely set foot in Avec Chateau, his 26-room mansion here, when he made a confession. ''I used to be embarrassed to show people my house,'' he said, standing in his Italian marble foyer. Mr. Perry, who has parlayed writing comic plays larded with music into a multimillion-dollar industry, said he feared that relatives and friends would find his $5 million home -- with swimming pool, waterfall, two prayer gardens, tennis courts, an indoor theater and a soon-to-be-constructed amphitheater -- ostentatious. He designed the house, in this Atlanta suburb, and is now building seven other stately homes to sell nearby.

VON a recent Saturday afternoon, a deconsecrated church bus tagged with graffiti -- ''Got Beer? We Do!'' ''Tammy Loves Tommy!'' -- bucked along a dirt and gravel lane. Elbows jutted at awkward angles from the windows. As the rattletrap crested each rut, a dozen heads bobbed like dashboard chihuahuas. Following in the bus's dusty wake came a pickup, fitted with a rack filled with inner tubes and decked in muddy carpeting. Three men who appeared to be in their early 20's hung from the rack like 10-year-olds on a jungle gym. Each deposited its passengers at a red clay landing, set in the shadow of the Highway 98 bridge on a bank of the Bogue Chitto River in southwestern Mississippi. And soon a flotilla of tubers emerged, river shoes on their feet, beer-filled coolers in their hands, wraparound sunglasses shielding their faces.

VLATE afternoon had come to that sprawling urban wonder known as the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge. Time to stop trimming the overgrowth along Cross Bay Boulevard. Time to bid goodnight to the box turtles, to the egrets, to the rufous-sided towhees warbling farewell from the trees. While a park ranger, Chris Olijnyk, stored the tools, his brother and fellow ranger, Steve Olijnyk, decided to check some open space about 50 feet off the road. Maybe someone was cultivating cannabis on federal land again, in an overly broad interpretation of the refuge's commitment to biodiversity.

VIt takes a good bit of moral indignation to produce the hilarious rants against the greedy speculators, corrupt politicians and assorted crooks, con artists and scavengers who are forever laying waste to South Florida in Carl Hiaasen's satirical crime novels. But it takes something stronger -- pure, unadulterated rage -- to pull off the humor in the act of romantic betrayal that opens SKINNY DIP (Knopf, $24.95).+ This black comedy is set on a luxury cruise ship plowing its way back to Fort Lauderdale after a sybaritic week in Caribbean waters. On board are a marine biologist named Chaz Perrone and his rich and lovely wife, Joey. To celebrate their second wedding anniversary, Joey gives Chaz a snazzy set of leather golf-club covers. In observance of the same occasion, Chaz tosses Joey overboard. Unluckily for Chaz, Joey survives by exercising her champion swimming style and clinging to a floating bale of Jamaican marijuana until she is rescued by Mick Stranahan, the burned-out ex-cop who memorably speared a killer with a stuffed marlin head in ''Skin Tight'' (1989). Once Joey recovers from her ordeal, she makes herself at home in Stranahan's stilt house and enlists his aid in getting revenge (or ''justice,'' as she prefers to call it) on Chaz. ''Something quick and dirty,'' she thinks.

VThe influence of MTV's ''Pimp My Ride'' -- the car-makeover show in which ugly junkers are revived, tricked out and otherwise transformed into flamboyant mobile spectacles under the watchful eye of a rap-artist host -- can be felt, among other places, at Sprewell Motorsports near Los Angeles. The car-culture landmark sells many accessories for luxury vehicles, but lately Vincent Pan, a Sprewell account executive, has noted a different kind of would-be customer: ''I don't want to say the cars are nonfunctional,'' he says, clearly implying that they might as well be. If this generation of auto-expressionists has reinvented one thing, it's the wheel. ''It's basically fashion now,'' says Peter MacGillivray of SEMA, the Specialty Equipment Market Association, which tracks sales related to automotive customizing. Putting on sharp-looking wheels that clearly aren't standard is relatively easy and offers instant gratification. According to SEMA, sales of specialty wheels, or rims, topped $3.3 billion in 2003 -- more than double the figure from 10 years ago. Custom wheels are ''the stepping stone'' for customization newbies, MacGillivray explains; modifying your engine or installing a plasma TV in the trunk come later.

VAfter four days of sometimes sharp exchanges, a prosecutor yesterday concluded his cross-examination of Daniel Rakowitz at a hearing to review his sanity, saying Mr. Rakowitz regularly changed his story when asked about the killing and dismemberment of his roommate in 1989. The prosecutor, Gary Galperin, an assistant Manhattan district attorney, displayed three placards with reproduced drawings of the crime scene that Mr. Rakowitz made at different times since his arrest in the killing of Monika Beerle, 26, his roommate and girlfriend.

VThe Tour de France stopped dithering in the Massif Central on Thursday and headed southwest toward the Pyrenees and a possible rendezvous with meaningful action, a missing ingredient in the race so far. This 11th of 20 daily stages, again marked by a long breakaway, was no different from its predecessors in its lack of overall significance, except to the winner, of course.

VSTEVEN BOCHCO is a little anxious. In a few weeks, the multiple Emmy Award-winning writer-producer will start sending scripts for the coming season of ''N.Y.P.D. Blue'' to ABC executives for their input. It's something Mr. Bochco has done for years, a first step in every episode's journey from writing room to living room. But Mr. Bochco is still smarting from lost battles with network censors last season, when he was forced to alter or delete four scenes with partial nudity after Janet Jackson's overexposure at the Super Bowl. ''I'm not doing anything particularly different this year than I've done in the past,'' he says. ''But I'm not going to do something I know is going to be really provocative either. If I do, they'll blur it. They'll cut it. They'll perform artless surgery.''

VSince the 1988 murders of Arlene and Seymour Tankleff at their waterfront home on Long Island, several people have said that a Selden man with a long criminal history had told them he was involved in the killings. Instead, the slain couple's teenage son, Martin, was prosecuted, found guilty and imprisoned. Mr. Tankleff has insisted that he is innocent, and on Tuesday his lawyers called the man, Joseph Creedon, to testify in Suffolk County Court in their bid to overturn the murder convictions.

But on Wednesday, Karlene Kovacs testified that he had admitted to her that he took part in the killings. Ms. Kovacs was called to the witness stand by lawyers for the slain couple's son, Martin. Martin Tankleff was convicted of the double homicide and has been imprisoned since 1990. Maintaining his innocence, he is appealing to overturn the guilty verdicts.

VAt the very beginning of ''A Home at the End of the World,'' Bobby Morrow, a round-faced 9-year-old who will grow up into Colin Farrell, walks in on his older brother, Carlton, having sex with his girlfriend. The girl flees out the window, but Carlton puts his arm around Bobby and tells him not to be freaked out. ''It's just love, man,'' he says, ''nothing but love.'' The film, adapted by Michael Cunningham from his 1990 novel and directed by a first-timer, Michael Mayer, tries hard to live up to Carlton's dewy, innocent romanticism. The older boy's tolerant, life-affirming faith in love (and also in drugs; in the second scene he feeds Bobby a child-size portion of LSD) is partly a period detail. It is, after all, 1967, the year of the Summer of Love. When Carlton dies in a freak household accident, crashing through a sliding glass door during a party, he passes on his hippie wisdom to Bobby.

VZACH BRAFF strolled into a sprawling suite at the Essex House hotel in Manhattan. He did not trip or fall flat on his face, crash into a wall or stumble over a side table, the way J. D. Dorian, the fresh-faced resident he plays on ''Scrubs,'' might have. Nor did he resemble Andrew Largeman, the passive, downbeat character he plays to great comic effect in the new movie ''Garden State.'' Mr. Braff was instead upright, animated and self-assured. ''J. D is the really goofy, silly side of me,'' he said as he sank into a plush sofa. ''Andrew Largeman is the introverted, melancholy side. The sad, drunk porcelain clown.''

VTHE plot of ''Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle,'' succinctly summarized in the movie's title, consists of an amusing, anarchic grab-bag of road-picture mishaps and low-comedy gags. Many of the comic elements are predictable (dumb stoners doing dumb, stoned things, sexual come-ons and gross-outs of various kinds) while others are less so, like the part when Neil Patrick Harris, playing himself, starts licking the headrests on a Honda. But a clever bait-and-switch early in the film signals its sly subversive intentions. Its director is Danny Leiner, who made ''Dude, Where's My Car?,'' and he seems at first to pick up more or less where that movie, or any of its illustrious predecessors going back to ''Porky's,'' left off. An ex-frat boy type, with a roomy office in a New York high-rise, is finishing up his work week. His pal, immediately recognizable as the wilder half of a classic buddy-movie pair, shows up proposing a fun-filled weekend of babes, booze and bong hits. But what about that big report due on Monday? No problem: just dump it on the Korean guy in the far cubicle. Our hero is free to pursue the carefree debauchery that is his birthright.

VI AM developing a fondness for weeds. Not that I don't hate pulling them up, but at some point my fury turned to admiration. My weed-of-the-year award goes to a mysterious stranger that sprouted early this summer in a little locust grove at my family farm here in Maryland. Some people call black locusts weeds, because they sprout so easily, and their long, sharp thorns make them a nuisance to dig up. But a weed, as the old saying goes, is a plant in the wrong place, and these native locust trees are in the right place.

VRunning back Ricky Williams, who retired from the Miami Dolphins last weekend, said that he had failed a third drug test for marijuana use and that it would cost him a four-game suspension if he decided to return to the N.F.L., The Miami Herald reported on its Web site yesterday. Williams said that marijuana played a larger role in his retirement than he indicated when he walked away after five seasons.

VThe stoner, gross-out comedy ''Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle'' has one foot here and one foot there. The here is a politically savvy universe where the title characters, 22-year-old New Jersey roommates who are Chinese-American and Indian-American, puncture ethnic stereotypes. But the other foot is rutted knee deep in the muck of perpetual puerility according to Hollywood. In this alligator-infested swamp, susceptible to rumbling earthquakes and vaporous volcanic eruptions, the humor of bodily functions and rampant cravings reigns. Were the movie cooked up in the 1970's, ''Harold and Kumar,'' which opens nationwide today, might have been called ''Cheech and Chong Get the Munchies.'' For no matter who's smoking the herb, the basics of stoner screen humor never really change. Attacks of hunger and indigestion, comic hallucinations and episodes of flat-out insensibility are scrambled together on the goofy roller coaster ride of dope.

VHOW to find drugs among 525 adolescents? One way is 525 urine samples. Another is DrugWipe, a hand-held test that identifies nanogram-size (one billionth of a gram) traces of drugs left on surfaces. The system has been used by the F.B.I. and the Drug Enforcement Administration; now more than 25 schools in Pennsylvania are using it, along with two middle schools and one high school in Suffolk County, Long Island. The principle is that students who are using drugs or have recently handled them leave a residue on anything they touch, including locker handles, computer keyboards, vending machines and sports equipment. DrugWipe, which resembles a home pregnancy test, can detect drug residue for up to eight weeks. One version of the test checks for marijuana, amphetamines (and derivatives like Ecstasy), cocaine and opiates in one swipe. If a line appears, you've got drugs.

VIT used to be that goldfish swallowing and stuffing students in telephone booths were all the rage on campus. Today's traditions are more likely to involve nudity, fire and intoxicants and be closely monitored by publicity-wary administrators. Some rituals have been abolished because of safety concerns or underage drinking. Recent casualties include spring couch burning at the University of Vermont and Princeton's Nude Winter Olympics. In one of the higher-profile incidents, the death of 12 people by collapsing logs in 1999 brought to an end the tradition of Texas A&M's bonfire on the eve of the annual football game against the University of Texas (the bonfire has since been revived off campus). But other traditions are going strong, sanctioned or not. Like their zanier predecessors, they are a long-remembered part of the college experience -- if occasionally rowdy, childish, illegal or all three.

VWHEN the London tabloid The Daily Star claimed that Jeffrey Archer, the Tory politician and best-selling novelist, had slept with a prostitute and paid her to keep quiet about it, he made what turned out to be a big mistake: he decided to fight back. He sued the paper for libel and was awarded $800,000 in 1987; but he had fabricated an alibi to win the case, partly by concocting false diaries, and that would come back to haunt him. In 2001, he was convicted of perjury and perverting the course of justice in the earlier trial, and sent to jail for four years. Getting caught with a prostitute and lying about it in court was, of course, a colossal humiliation. But the unembarrassable Lord Archer -- who left British politics in disgrace three times, in 1974, 1986 and 1999 -- also saw an opportunity. Last year he published ''A Prison Diary,'' a memoir of the 22 days he spent in a high-security unit in London, and it has been adapted into a play, ''Prison Diary, Part I: Hell,'' that opens at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival next Sunday. It's a fish-out-of-water story in which Lord Archer comes in contact with murderers, rap music and, worst of all, prison food.

VWhen Aaron, a 33-year-old writer from New York, decided to get help for his five-year addiction to painkillers, there was really only one option. Every morning, he visited a local clinic for a small cup of methadone, the standard treatment for addiction to heroin and other opiates since the 1960's. But his life soon revolved around the clinic's hours, he said, and the daily routine was humiliating.

VAn Upper East Side jewelry designer was arraigned yesterday on charges of possessing child pornography and drugs and tampering with physical evidence. The designer, Clive Kandel, 53, who pleaded not guilty, could face up to seven years in prison if convicted, officials with the Manhattan district attorney's office said. After executing a search warrant at Mr. Kandel's East 87th Street apartment, police officers recovered cocaine, marijuana and a badly scratched CD-ROM with video clips of children engaging in sexual activity, officials said. Mr. Kandel remains free without bail. His lawyer did not return a call for comment. Susan Saulny (NYT)

VTHE commissioner of the N.B.A. must be a little restless when his cast of Olympic superstars -- O.K., pro replacement players -- feels compelled to celebrate a must-win exhibition game against Germany yesterday like Y.M.C.A. league champs. But there the once mighty were, with Allen Iverson's sprite-sized body buried beneath U.S.A. jerseys after his 30-foot heave was swallowed by net at the buzzer for a victory over Dirk Nowitzki and The Lederhosen 11 -- a team that didn't even qualify for the Olympics.

VThe little fish are dried and laid out flat and look more like bookmarks than creatures that once swam in water, just another in a galaxy of species on the sidewalks of Chinatown that the police lieutenant -- a neighborhood girl back when the girls were all Parisis and Ciprianos and Russos -- cannot identify by name or purpose. ''Who's in charge here?'' she bellows, deep-voiced, into the store. Curious passers-by join the crowd on the corner of Mott and Grand Streets. She couldn't care less if the fish are dead or still flapping or an endangered species or made of uranium: they are stacked on the sidewalk without a permit, and this store has been warned before.

VA CULT gives its members license to feel superior to the rest of the universe, and so does a cult movie: it confers hipness on those who grok what the mainstream audience can't. Joel and Ethan Coen's 1998 hyperintellectual stoner noir bowling comedy ''The Big Lebowski,'' starring Jeff Bridges as Jeff (The Dude) Lebowski, has the requisite exclusivity of a cult classic: it bombed at the box office; it was met with shrugs by many critics who had arguably overpraised the Coen brothers' Academy Award-winning ''Fargo'' (1996); and it has amassed an obsessive following on cable and video and by word of mouth. Nowadays, quoting its intricate, absurdist, often riotously profane dialogue earns you coolness points in widely disparate circles. Some would even say that the cult of ''The Big Lebowski'' is going mainstream. It has a rolling national convention, for starters: the Lebowski Fest, which in June attracted 4,000 followers in Louisville, Ky., and on Friday arrives in New York City. For two days, Lebowski fans (referred to as Achievers) will dress up as their favorite character (or prop, like a severed toe), dig some far-out rock bands at the Knitting Factory, bowl in far-out Queens, imbibe White Russians (and maybe less licit substances) and spend a lot of time shouting lines at one another like:

VThe thick scrub along the Rio Grande in McAllen, Tex., within shouting distance of Reynosa, Mexico, is strewn with discarded bits of clothing and black trash bags used as flotation devices, remnants of countless trips across the river by illegal immigrants. Sometimes the evidence is fresher -- like a damp-haired Candida Mercedes Melendez Castillo, 28, from Chinandega, Nicaragua, who popped out of the brush the other day at noon just as the United States Border Patrol was passing through with a reporter in tow.

ssVabstract
p29107
VNew Dept of Homeland Security rules would give border officers broad authority in many cases to bypass immigration courts and quickly deport illegal immigrants other than Mexicans or Canadians; on any given day, close to 300 illegal immigrants from Central and South America are apprehended by 1,500 Border Patrol officers in busy McAllen, Tex, sector, which includes 284 miles of Rio Grande and 19 South Texas counties; unknown number of others make it through; in addition to tracking illegal immigrants and drug smugglers, agents are particularly on terrorism watch; small McAllen airport is one area of enhanced antiterrorism enforcement, with Border Patrol agents scrutinizing all non-American passengers; photos (M)

VHere's how Brian Dykstra describes George W. Bush: ''My A.D.D.-suffering, dyslexic, drunk-driving Bush Klan president with a 13-minute attention span, leaky brain pan'' -- we pause here to omit a deprecating anatomical reference -- the ''I.Q. of a cracked blue soap dish, the verbal skills of a glue-sniffing gerbil with social-anxiety disorder'' with ''that severely self-medicated wife (and who can blame her?).'' There are several Broadway shows the Republican delegates won't be attending during their convention at the end of the month, they say. ''Avenue Q,'' for instance, might not go over well with the ''defense of marriage'' set. One Off Broadway production you can be sure they won't be flocking to is ''Brian Dykstra: Cornered & Alone,'' but Democrats and environmentalists are going to find it enormously satisfying.

VLIKE the 39-cent burgers at the heart of its, uh, plot, the new movie ''Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle'' is not for everyone. But the two guys raised in Randolph who wrote it say it just has to be watched with the right (perhaps bloodshot) eye. ''It's a stoner, youth, road trip, broad comedy that anyone can enjoy,'' said Jon Hurwitz, 26, in a telephone interview from the West Hollywood apartment he shares with Hayden Schlossberg, a childhood friend and his writing partner, who is also 26. ''The ultimate goal is to laugh as much as possible.''

VWhen Mayor Brian P. Stack decided to redesign a park on New York Avenue in this working-class slice of northeastern New Jersey, he asked local Dominicans for a new name. They suggested Juan Pablo Duarte -- an intellectual patriot who led the Dominican Republic to independence in 1844 -- so Mayor Stack ordered plaques and a bust, and he never looked back. During a tour of the three-quarter-acre park, which opened last week, the mayor talked of the importance of celebrating the contributions of Dominicans to the community, ''to give them a part of Union City.''

VThe area around the crime scene was as picturesque as a postcard. A lazy river ran through it, the lush green mountains of Shenandoah County, Va., formed a rustic backdrop and an old wooden covered bridge and sun-bleached hayfields completed the tableau. The crime scene itself was another story. The body was found on July 17, 2003, by a fisherman and his son. It was badly decomposed, lying contorted in the underbrush near a brier patch on the west bank of the Shenandoah River. The age, sex and race of the victim were difficult to determine, but the body appeared to be that of a young woman.

VJoining in Hollywood's latest penchant for political documentaries, the filmmaker David O. Russell is completing a documentary about the Iraqi war that is to be shown ahead of his 1999 movie ''Three Kings'' during a theatrical rerelease planned for the fall. Warner Brothers is financing the $180,000 project, which involves interviewing Iraqi refugees who acted as extras in ''Three Kings,'' the caper about the 1991 Persian Gulf War (starring George Clooney), and American veterans of the current war in Iraq.

VIT takes a lot to shock readers of Nest, the quarterly magazine of interiors. Joseph Holtzman wrote one of his editor's letters from what he called a ''small, well-proportioned room'' in a psychiatric hospital. Furniture coverage included close-ups of electric chairs. But Mr. Holtzman's latest issue could be the most surprising: It will be the last. Mr. Holtzman, 47, said he felt that Nest, which he underwrote himself, starting in 1997, had run its course artistically. ''I'm afraid I'm going to get bored and that it's going to show in my work,'' he said. In 26 issues, he said, he has designed more than 4,000 pages and examined countless images.

VAs every red-blooded American male is at least partially aware, 1972 was the year camping trips lost their innocence. That was when the movie ''Deliverance'' introduced a new specter into the horror show of macho nightmares. Thanks to ''Deliverance'' and many subsequent rip-offs, every camper knows that behind every tree may lurk a sadistic, rotten-toothed hillbilly itching to rape a soft city slicker and make him squeal like a pig in front of his friends. The homosexual panic instilled by ''Deliverance'' fuels the running joke (if that's the word for it) driving the uneasy laughs evoked by the loathsome comedy ''Without a Paddle,'' which opens today nationwide. Three buddies, 30 going on 13, embark on a ridiculous treasure hunt in the Pacific Northwest. Although no rape actually takes place, the threat of it is a constant source of leering humor. When the treasure hunters run afoul of a pair of gun-toting marijuana growers who resemble outlaw bikers, rape, torture and murder seem probable punishments, should the campers be caught.

VThe words of an old proverb ''Tell me who you walk with, and I'll tell you who you are'' -- gained new meaning on Thursday with the release of a national study showing that teenagers whose friends were sexually active were more likely to smoke, drink or use illegal drugs. Teenagers who reported that at least half of their friends were sexually active were 31 times likelier to get drunk, 5 1/2 times likelier to smoke and 22 1/2 times likelier to have tried marijuana, according to the study, released by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.

VIn ''Mean Creek,'' the first feature written and directed by Jacob Aaron Estes, a group of kids in a small town in Oregon decide to take revenge on a bully. The scenario is somewhat reminiscent of Larry Clark's ''Bully,'' a horrific and exploitative tale of lawless youth. The contrast between the two films is worth noting, since Mr. Estes, in the best Sundance tradition, is careful not to let his fascination with errant young people drift into exploitation. Where ''Bully'' was prurient and cynical, ''Mean Creek'' is earnest almost to a fault, exploring the moral difficulties of its characters with heartfelt -- and at times heartsick -- empathy. Sam (Rory Culkin) is a small, sad-eyed middle schooler who is beaten up at recess by George (Josh Peck), an overweight boy with a volcanic temper. Sam's older brother, Rocky (Trevor Morgan), decides to teach George a lesson, and he and his friends Marty (Scott Mechlowicz) and Clyde (Ryan Kelley) plan a vengeful prank. Along with Sam and Millie (Carly Schroeder), the only girl in the movie, they invite George on a boating expedition, pretending that it is Sam's birthday. Their goal is humiliation rather than violence, but George turns out to be a more complicated person than any of the others suspect. His mean streak is mixed up with a quick sense of humor, and also a vulnerability that incites protectiveness in some of his would-be tormentors and sadism in others.

VAs part of a plan to increase surveillance of the Canadian border, federal officials on Friday opened the first of five planned bases for regular flights to look for drug runners and others crossing illegally by air or land. The base of operations, called the Bellingham Air Marine Branch, is to have a staff of nearly 70, two helicopters, an airplane and a high-speed boat by year's end. Similar bases have policed the Mexican border for three decades, but the facility here is the first on the Canadian border.

The report is to be released today. A1 The highest-ranking Army reservist charged in the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse case said in a statement that he would plead guilty to at least some of the charges. The statement did not specify the charges to which Staff Sgt. Ivan L. Frederick II intends to plead guilty; he has a pretrial hearing scheduled for today. A6

VNo one had run faster than the United States' 100-meter sprinters -- at least without a baton. But put the stick in an unpracticed American's hand on the track in these Olympics, and it transforms talent into tumult. Maurice Greene said he and his American 4x100 relay teammates -- Shawn Crawford, Justin Gatlin and Coby Miller -- had practiced handoffs together twice, and only once in a meet. That was nearly three weeks ago.

VOver the decades the Yippies have become infamous as a counterculture group known for colorful pranks and criticizing capitalism. Recently, though, the group entered the world of high-stakes Manhattan real estate, buying the East Village building that has been its longtime headquarters for $1.2 million. In 1973, a few members of the group -- begun by Abbie Hoffman, known for scattering dollar bills onto the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, and others and officially called the Youth International Party -- moved into the three-story building at 9 Bleecker Street, near the Bowery. Over the years their monthly rent rose to more than $8,000 from $675. In 2000 the building was sold, and the Yippies faced eviction.

VOn an ordinary news day, CNN is like a sip of iced tea. Fox News is a gulp of Jolt Cola. It is the favorite news source of conservative-minded viewers, but Fox's anti-liberal sensibility is not its only draw. Even on matters as uncontested as the weather, Fox News's heart ticks to a faster, louder beat; it is a network that presents the news with pizazz and a frisky tone. (''Back to you, guys'' is how reporters in the field address the anchors in the studio.) And its top commentators express a righteous indignation -- mostly at the mainstream media, Hollywood liberals and the Democratic Party -- that envelops loyal viewers in a warm, cozy duvet of rage.

VJAMES R. BURTON, who once served a year in federal prison, still gets a kick out of the signs at his marijuana plantation here reminding employees whom to call in the event of an emergency: the Dutch police. Sixteen years ago, Mr. Burton did time in the maximum security jail in Marion, Ill., and lost his family farm in Bowling Green, Ky., after being caught with an estimated $112,000 worth of marijuana that he said he needed to stave off glaucoma. Last year, the Dutch government gave him a five-year contract to grow more than 10 times that much.

In April, when the French drug company Sanofi-Synthélabo vanquished all other players with a long-shot takeover bid for a much larger French-German rival, Aventis, many commentators focused on the role of politicians in Paris.

VAnticipating a barrage of unflattering accusations and innuendo about President Bush's personal life in a soon-to-be-published book by the celebrity biographer Kitty Kelley, the Bush campaign has opened a wave of advance counterstrikes intended to undermine her credibility. A representative of the White House recently called Neal Shapiro, president of NBC News, to discourage that network from broadcasting interviews with Ms. Kelley about the book on its ''Today'' program and on its MSNBC cable program ''Hardball With Chris Matthews,'' a network executive said.

VWeldon H. Angelos, a 25-year-old producer of rap records, will be sentenced Tuesday in federal court in Salt Lake City for selling several hundred dollars in marijuana on each of three occasions, his first offenses. He faces 63 years in prison. Laws that set mandatory minimum sentences require 55 of the 63 years because Mr. Angelos carried a gun while he sold the drugs.

VTHE WB network has become almost exclusively associated with youth. That may be about to change with the premiere of ''Jack & Bobby'' at 9 tonight. The new series centers on a single mother (Christine Lahti) and her two high-school-age sons (Matt Long and Logan Lerman), one of whom grows up to be president of the United States. As a result, the show looks forward and back at the same time, exploring issues of politics and current events. Interspersed with contemporary scenes about the young men's formative experiences are documentary-like interviews with people who talk about the brother who became president 40 years later. It was the dual nature of the plot that first attracted WB executives. ''In addition to being a family show, it was a show about the making of a president,'' said Carolyn G. Bernstein, the executive vice president for drama development at the network. ''Something that felt like it had real substance and gravitas.''

VIN a two-hour meeting last month to ''break out'' the story for the seventh episode of the new WB drama ''Jack and Bobby,'' Greg Berlanti and his team of eight writers discussed Kobe Bryant, the odds of Mr. Berlanti's newly discovered lobster allergy proving fatal, and where Billy Joel played on his 1990 ''Storm Front'' concert tour. Then Mr. Berlanti stood up and led a short, intense discussion about what -- a health scare? fear of aging? -- might drive Grace, the romance-weary mother of the two title characters, played by Christine Lahti, into the arms of a younger man. Mr. Berlanti sat again and asked one of the writers how her effort to quit smoking was going. He had decided several weeks earlier that she should quit, and asked all the writers to give up something in solidarity (he gave up fries). Then the discussion turned to the subtle dynamics of self-sabotage and how it might be affecting one of their teenage characters. The moment Mr. Berlanti headed off to another meeting, the other writers began showering him with praise. He's their boss, of course. But in speaking about him, the writers sounded more like the sensitive, occasionally sentimental characters whose dialogue they create than the hardened television professionals they are.

VSan Pablo Avenue was once the thriving, racy final stretch of the nation's first highway between New York and San Francisco, a center for jazz halls, gambling houses and brothels. Today it is an unremarkable thoroughfare, littered along isolated stretches here with used drug needles and liquor bottles, a place where prostitutes entice customers from gritty curbsides. San Pablo is also at the heart of a bid to decriminalize sex for sale in California.

VFAMILY The Real Story of The Bush Dynasty By Kitty Kelley Illustrated. 705 pages. Doubleday. $29.95 Kitty Kelley's catty new book about the Bush family is a perfect artifact of our current political culture in which unsubstantiated attacks on Senator John Kerry's Vietnam War record and old questions about President Bush's National Guard service get more attention than present-day issues like the Iraq war, the economy, intelligence reform or the assault weapons ban.

VAs Hurricane Ivan approached Jamaica last week, government and business leaders worried that the country's fragile economic recovery would be knocked into a tailspin. But while at least 15 people died in the storm over the weekend, damage was generally lighter than expected. The vital tourism business and the country's second-largest industry, bauxite mining, seem to have been barely touched.

VAt 3:40 a.m. on July 25, 2003, according to the police, Nicolette R. offered to perform oral sex on an undercover officer on Bryant Avenue in the Bronx for $40. She had been arrested once before on prostitution charges, in another city, but had been quickly let go when her pimp paid the fine. This time, the officer thought she looked very young. She was 12, it turned out. But the officer went ahead and charged her as a prostitute, and that is when the complicated fight for Nicolette began.

VThe jury's verdict on March 2 was guilty: a retired firefighter convicted of stealing souvenirs while volunteering at ground zero. Six weeks later, his lawyers appealed, arguing not over the testimony at the trial, but over the jury that decided the verdict. Specifically, the lawyers argued, Juror No. 4 was drunk. They said that after the guilty verdict, he approached the defendant, his brother, wife and lawyers, wobbly and glassy-eyed, to apologize for finding him guilty and telling him that he understood how difficult it must have been to work at the World Trade Center site. Someone smelled alcohol on his breath.

VKITTY KELLEY keeps an unusual shrine to herself. Around and above the toilet in the first-floor half-bath of her Georgetown Victorian hang framed cartoons, magazine covers and newspaper front pages that recall the public figures Ms. Kelley has clawed, the hisses of protest she provoked, the catfights that ensued.

Audience President Bush, in his fourth annual address to the General Assembly, told foreign leaders that Iraq was on its way to stability and democracy and called for ''a new definition of security'' that allows nations to act together to extend freedom to countries gripped by tyranny. A1 A militant group posted an Internet message saying it had beheaded the second American hostage in two days -- presumably Jack Hensley, an engineer kidnapped in Baghdad last week -- and would release a video of the second killing soon. The U.S. military confirmed that the body of the first hostagehad been found. A11

VA Texas man who is quoted in Kitty Kelley's new book about the Bush family as saying that the first lady, Laura Bush, smoked and sold marijuana in her college days, said on Tuesday that his remarks were taken out of context. He said he had no firsthand information about any drug-related activity by Mrs. Bush. The man, Robert Nash, is quoted on Page 575 of Ms. Kelley's book, ''The Family: The Real Story of the Bush Dynasty.'' Speaking of Mrs. Bush, Ms. Kelley writes: ''She graduated from Southern Methodist University in 1968 and had been known in her college days as a go-to girl for dime bags of marijuana. 'She not only smoked dope,' said Robert Nash, an Austin friend of many in Laura's S.M.U. class, 'but she sold dope.'''

VAs many as one of every seven black men in Atlanta who have been convicted of a felony, and one of every four in Providence, R.I., cannot vote in this year's election, according to a pair of studies released yesterday. The studies, the first to look at felon disenfranchisement laws' effect on voting in individual cities, add to a growing body of evidence that those laws have a disproportionate effect on African-Americans because the percentage of black men with felony convictions is much larger than their share of the general population.

VIt was a moment three years in the making as the Long Island electrician accused of killing the Manhattan financier R. Theodore Ammon strode into court here, winked at his family and sat down with his lawyers, ready to begin his murder trial. But in an incident that may cause a mistrial, the whole process halted. Before a packed courtroom, the Suffolk County prosecutor, Janet Albertson, stood up and said that the defendant, Daniel J. Pelosi, had been tape recorded making plans to intimidate and assault witnesses, tamper with the jury and threaten her children.

VRIKERS ISLAND is not one prison but a world of prisons -- scores of buildings identified by cryptic acronyms, separated by ribbon wire, linked by a fleet of rickety Department of Correction buses; between jail and jail, you see nothing, except stray cats, sea gulls and the occasional hawk. The population seems almost exclusively black, Latino and poor; and disturbingly young. Many are ''substance abusers,'' a term that can mask a host of unspoken catastrophes. One kid's fidgets may be the result of crack; another's college plans froze when he was caught with marijuana. ''I came to Rikers to meet my father,'' one young prisoner told me proudly.

VRicky Williams wants to rejoin the Miami Dolphins and has asked the National Football League how soon he can return, his agent said yesterday. It was unclear whether Williams must serve a suspension for the rest of this season for repeated violations of the league drug program. He has asked the N.F.L. for a hearing to clarify his status, but no date has been set.

VTENNIS Virus Ends Henin-Hardenne's Season Justine Henin-Hardenne, a former top-ranked player, ended her season yesterday because of continued problems with an energy-sapping virus. The blood disorder has weakened her since April, although she won the singles gold medal at the Olympics. ''The last strength I had was in Athens,'' she said. ''Afterward it was tough to recover.''

VRapper's Rap Sheet The gangsta rapper Beanie Sigel, below, has been sentenced to a year in federal prison, two years' probation and a $25,000 fine on a gun possession charge, despite his claim that he has become a changed man since the incident in 2002, The Associated Press reported. ''I'm not the guy that people think I am,'' he said, appearing before United States District Judge R. Barclay Surrick in a courtroom in Philadelphia where his supporters included his fellow rapper Jay-Z. Gesturing toward his children, he said, ''I want then to be able to lift their heads up and say: 'That's my dad. That's Dwight Grant. Not Beanie Sigel.''' The prosecutor, Curtis Douglas, quoted from lyrics on a forthcoming album, in which Mr. Sigel, 30, fantasizes about taking revenge on his enemies by pouring acid on their children and raping their pregnant girlfriends. ''The very idea that this defendant is here as a role model is somewhat repulsive,'' the prosecutor said. The judge cited Mr. Sigel's charity efforts and treatment for drug abuse in not imposing the maximum sentence of more than three years for the 2002 incident, in which the police said he ran from his Cadillac Escalade after being stopped and tossed away a loaded gun. Officers said they found prescription drugs and marijuana in the car. Mr. Sigel's rap sheet, dating to his teenage years, makes it illegal for him to own a gun. He is facing trial in January on charges of shooting a man outside a Philadelphia bar and on charges of punching another man in the face. Jazz in Brooklyn To mention the Brooklyn Paramount Theater these days is to conjure an image of Alan Freed presiding over a frenzied rock 'n' roll show starring the likes of Chuck Berry or Fats Domino. But the 4,188-seat theater, opened in 1928 as a movie palace with painted clouds on its sky-blue ceiling, Renaissance-style statuary, huge chandeliers, burgundy-velvet upholstery and fountains filled with goldfish, was also once a mecca for top names in jazz, like Duke Ellington, above right, Charlie Parker, Ella Fitzgerald and Miles Davis. Owned since 1950 by Long Island University and now mainly a gymnasium, the theater will be honored on Friday as a landmark in jazz history. An all-day conference, ''Remembering Jazz at the Brooklyn Paramount''; an exhibition featuring photographs of jazz greats who played there; and an evening concert will be part of the tribute. Information: (718)780-4587 or www.brooklyn.liu.edu/rememberingjazz. Footnotes Including 51 paintings by Impressionists like Monet, electronic music by Jean-Michel Jarre and 230 blue-and-white banners strung by the conceptual artist Daniel Buren along a 1,200-foot marble passageway at the Temple of Heaven, the ''Year of France in China'' has begun in Beijing, Agence France-Presse reported. The nine-month program features more than 100 events, among them concerts, exhibitions and film festivals. Queen Margrethe of Denmark will design the costumes and scenery for a play based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale ''Thumbelina,'' to be performed in the Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen next year, the 200th anniversary of the author's birth, The Associated Press reported. The queen, 64, has designed other shows and illustrated many books, including a 1977 Danish edition of Tolkien's ''Lord of the Rings.'' Peter Cincotti, the acclaimed 21-year-old pop and jazz pianist, singer, composer and arranger, will perform on Nov. 10 at 8 p.m. at the new Frederick P. Rose Hall in the Time Warner Center. Luciano Pavarotti is taking his charity benefit concert, held for 10 years in his hometown, Modena, Italy, on the road. An ANSA news agency report relayed by The Associated Press said yesterday that the next ''Pavarotti and Friends'' concert will take place in São Paulo, Brazil, at a date in December to be announced.

VWith the spring planting season just beginning in the Southern Hemisphere, Brazil, the world's leading exporter of soybeans, is in a quandary. The government has been unable to secure congressional approval for the planting of genetically modified seed stock, but farmers are ignoring the ban and sowing the seeds, many obtained illegally, anyway. The messy situation promises to create additional uncertainty in the trading of soybeans, one of the most important and widely consumed commodities in markets around the world. After hitting a high of $10.55 a bushel in March, soybean prices have tumbled nearly a third as China abruptly cut back on its purchases.

VRobert A. Durst, the New York real estate heir who was acquitted of murder nearly a year ago, was arrested yesterday on weapons charges in Galveston, Tex., one day before he was scheduled to be released from jail. Federal marshals took Mr. Durst, 61, into custody at the Galveston County Jail and moved him to a detention center in Houston, where he awaits transfer to Pennsylvania to face two gun charges. ''This is a vindictive prosecution,'' said Dick DeGuerin, Mr. Durst's lawyer. ''He already did three years. You figure out whether this is retaliation.''

VIt is no mystery why, one spring day two years ago, an Amtrak passenger train jumped the tracks near Crescent City, Fla., and skidded to a stop on its side, killing 4 people and injuring 142. Investigators concluded that the track, owned by the big freight railroad CSX, had not been properly stabilized and that management's oversight of maintenance had been lax. But when millions of dollars in damage claims arose from the crash, it was not CSX, a multibillion-dollar corporation, that paid them. It was Amtrak, the perennial money loser that survives only with regular infusions of cash from American taxpayers.

VArticle in series Death on the Tracks, on ways freight railroads have sidestepped blame in fatal accidents, explains how CSX and other railroads use taxpayer-subsidized Amtrak to shield themselves from tens of millions of dollars in liability; Amtrak paid out millions of dollars in claims from recent accidents in Florida and Maryland, caused by CSX's poor track maintenance; has for three decades paid out claims regardless of fault as condition for using freight lines' tracks, shifting burden from profitable corporations to taxpayers and removing incentive for railroads to keep their tracks safe; even Amtrak officials cannot say how much indemnification has cost railroad, which needed $1.2 billion in subsidies this year; analysis of records obtained through Freedom of Information Act shows that Amtrak has paid more than $186 million since 1984 for accidents that killed 53 people and injured nearly 1,300, and for which freight lines were mostly or partly responsible; photos; chart; most cases were not covered by Amtrak's insurance; Angelica Palank, whose police officer husband was killed in South Carolina crash in 1991 that was caused by faulty CSX switch, says she hoped her $68.3-million settlement would chasten CSX, and was stunned to learn that money came from Amtrak; other accidents involving egregious CSX conduct recounted, as well as industry's expensive lobbying of Congress; federal Judge Oliver Gasch's 1997 ruling questioning legality of blanket immunity for railroads led to pro-industry law that reaffirmed Amtark's legal right to indemnify freight lines (M)

VAccording to official maps, this remote stretch of the Amazon is an Indian reservation, set aside as the homeland of a half dozen tribes. Theoretically, that makes it off-limits to uninvited visitors. Yet white settlers have ignored the billboards that proclaim this cluster of villages to be ''protected land'' and have built an airstrip, a fancy technical school, a town hall and stores, all protected by a new military base. Farther south, sprawling rice farms divert water from streams where Indians fish and bathe, and clandestine gold and diamond mines are flourishing. All over the 1,000-square-mile Raposa Serra do Sol Indigenous Reservation, white encroachment has been accelerating and becoming bolder.

VBruce Palmer, who played bass guitar for Buffalo Springfield, the influential though short-lived folk-rock band that exemplified what was called the West Coast sound in the 1960's, died on Oct. 1 in Belleville, Ontario. He was 58. The cause was a heart attack, said Liese Rugo, a music publicist.

VIN a gated condominium community in Fort Lee, N.J., the dense shrubbery suggests a botanical garden more than a residential one. A lantern at the foot of each house's staircase is illuminated before sundown, and there is a late-model sport utility vehicle in nearly every drive. But there is only one hot-pink Range Rover. That is how you can tell the house of Cameron Giles. For the better part of two years, pink has been the dominant color in the life of Mr. Giles, a rapper who performs as Cam'ron. ''When I did pink, I did it so I wouldn't be dressing like everybody else,'' he said. The color seemed guaranteed to set him apart in the world of hip-hop, where men's style tends to conform to notions of hypermasculinity.

VSTEPHANIE BISHARA, a third grader at Crompond Elementary School here, was pretty excited about school picture day. She had picked her outfit with care: powder-blue sweat pants and a light blue T-shirt bearing the word ''Princess,'' in cloud-and-sky-motif lettering. On her flowing black hair, she had perched a rhinestone tiara. With chin slightly raised, a regal smile on her face and a last-minute adjustment or two to the ensemble, Stephanie posed for her individual portrait. A willing subject like Stephanie is every school photographer's dream. In kindergarten she may have been a little shy; by the time middle school comes around she might feel self-conscious in front of the camera. This year she brought just the right attitude to the session, and it was over in less than a minute.

VSenator John Kerry and President Bush devoted four and a half hours and nearly 45,000 words to three detailed and substantial debates. But a single remark by Mr. Kerry, noting that Vice President Dick Cheney's daughter Mary is a lesbian, has shadowed his strong performance and given Republicans an opening to slow the momentum Mr. Kerry got from the debates, some Democrats say. Amid signs of Democratic concern, Mr. Kerry's advisers acknowledged Sunday that some voters perceived Mr. Kerry's remark as an invasion of Ms. Cheney's privacy, a gratuitous personal insult, or a crass political calculation by which Mr. Kerry was trying to drive a wedge between Mr. Cheney and conservatives unaware that his daughter was gay.

But 25 percent of students in city high schools still engage in sexual behavior that puts them at risk for sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. And they say that experimentation with drinking or sex often starts before high school, at age 13 or younger.

V''WE'RE just following the traditions of our forefathers,'' said Paul Gilman yesterday as he brandished a copy of the United States Constitution under the inflated green alien hanging from the dome light in Ralph Nader Corporate Crime Fighting Unit No. 4. ''And our foremothers,'' corrected his partner, Don Hickok.

VA Paper Life By Tatum O'Neal 285 pages. HarperCollins. $24.95. West of Then By Tara Bray Smith 319 pages. Simon & Schuster. $24. When beautiful, substance-abusing people treat their children negligently, they scar them with legacies of doubt, pain and self-loathing. That's the bad news. The good news is that this is a gift that keeps on giving, at least as far as memoir material is concerned. If Mom was so high that she left her kids locked in a garage, revenge can be as sweet as the Cool Whip they were left to eat.

VFOR years, Cuttyhunk Island has been a Mecca for striped bass fishermen, especially in autumn, when the bass congregate off its rocky shore on their migration south. According to ''The Wise Fisherman's Encyclopedia,'' published in 1951, Cuttyhunk is ''the Grand Central Station of north Atlantic striped bass fishing.'' It is a little harder to get to than Grand Central itself though, especially now through April when the ferry from New Bedford, Mass., makes only one round trip a week, on Fridays, to this point at the end of the Elizabeth Island chain -- eight small islands projecting like a spur off Cape Cod's heel at Woods Hole. That is why on a recent chilly clear October afternoon, my friend Taylor Hoyt and I boarded Captain John Paul Hunt's Seahorse water taxi for the trip across Buzzard's Bay to Cuttyhunk, with warm clothes, fly and spin fishing equipment and a bucket of a dozen live eels.

VSince leaving home in Philadelphia as a heralded high school basketball player, the stops for Eddie Griffin have been brief and volatile. One year at Seton Hall, where he punched a teammate in the locker room after a game. A year and a half with the Houston Rockets, where he encountered legal troubles. And less than a month with the Nets, where he entered alcohol rehabilitation before playing a game.

VJudicial elections, which used to be staid and decorous affairs, have been transformed this year into loud and vicious fights, fueled by money, venom and television. Campaign spending has skyrocketed. In one Illinois race, two vying candidates have raised $5 million. In West Virginia, a group financed by business interests is spending $2.5 million to defeat a sitting State Supreme Court justice. About a third of the total spending nationwide comes from interest groups, much of it from the independent but partisan organizations known as 527's. Their main contributors are business interests and plaintiffs' lawyers, and their agenda is most often the election of judges who could help -- or the defeat of judges who could hinder -- efforts to impose limits on lawsuits seeking damages for injuries.

VSomeone told Kenyon Martin last week that powder blue and yellow were not his colors, but Martin has embraced his similarly clad teammates a mile higher than New Jersey and 1,700 miles away. Martin is a Denver Nugget and not a Net, even though his three electric seasons with Jason Kidd will be forever ingrained in his game. With Kidd upset because the Nets let go of Martin, the high-flying forward, Martin said it did not have to come to this.

VWhile he was writing uplifting screenplays for mainstream movies like ''Mrs. Soffel'' (1984) and ''Philadelphia'' (1993), Ron Nyswaner's real life was a darker, messier affair. As described in his just-published memoir, ''Blue Days, Black Nights'' (Advocate Books), the years from 1992 to 1997 were a debilitating marathon of drugs, suicide attempts and paid-for sex. Though it concentrates on his enigmatic relationship with a hustler named Johan -- whose death during a Las Vegas binge sends Mr. Nyswaner into a violent tailspin of self-recrimination -- the uncompromising book also paints a hilarious portrait of a Hollywood that's louche and yet primly moralistic. Mr. Nyswaner talked to Jesse Green about those contradictions. It's 1982, you're 21, you've sold your first script, and your first agent has an assistant whose main job seems to be to stick spoonfuls of coke under your nose. By my 10th hour in Hollywood, I'd imbibed cocaine, Quaaludes, marijuana, bourbon, Scott Thorson, Liberace -- and insulted Bette Midler. And it was really fun. And then the agent worries that he's corrupted you. Do you blame Hollywood, in part, for what later became your drug odyssey? I am a victim of nothing other than myself. You write that you're sober and clean now. Is Hollywood? Oh my God, it's so boringly straight, you're lucky if you get a buzz from the fizz of your Perrier. The book doesn't conform to a standard Hollywood arc. We know from Page 1 that Johan is dead, and his fate doesn't change, he doesn't return as an angel, there's no transcendence. There is a model for that structure in ''Sunset Boulevard,'' which is narrated by dead William Holden. As for transcendence, on the very last page of my book, I say that Johan's death motivated me to change my life. But you're right, I don't dwell on the redemption, I dwell on the descent, because it's more entertaining. We've had enough of Dr. Phil telling us we need to be redeemed. I'm telling people to find passion. Just make sure it doesn't kill you. Or anyone else. If you were making this story for a studio, how do you think you'd have to alter it? The crack has to go. Turn Johan into a woman. I think he could die in the end, but I'd have to fall in love with someone else by then and deliver a really moving eulogy in which I describe the lesson I learned. Which would be: When God closes a window he opens a door. Is that even true? With what you've been through and written -- most of the Hollywood figures are quite recognizable -- won't it be harder for you to keep working? No, the last three years have been the busiest and best in my career. ''Soldier's Girl'' on Showtime won a Peabody Award. Edward Norton is making ''The Painted Veil'' next year. The only taboo in Hollywood is failure.

VPublic outrage over the murder of Polly Klaas, a 12-year-old who had been kidnapped from her bedroom by a man who had repeatedly committed violent crimes, was the driving force behind California's passage 10 years ago of the country's harshest ''three strikes'' sentencing law. Now the Klaas family is at the center of an election battle over an initiative that would significantly scale back parts of the 1994 law. This time, Polly's father and grandfather are on opposite sides of an impassioned campaign that criminal justice experts say reflects a broad rethinking of the nation's tough-on-crime legislation of a decade ago.

VOhio was a confusing patchwork of litigation and election board hearings on Thursday as Democratic and Republican lawyers waged courtroom battles from Cincinnati to Newark, N.J., over the rights of tens of thousands of Ohioans to cast ballots next week. At the heart of the legal jousting was an effort by the state Republican Party to challenge 23,000 new voter registrations in 62 counties. On Wednesday, Judge Susan J. Dlott of Federal District Court in Cincinnati temporarily blocked hearings for those challenges in six counties, including the state's two largest, Cuyahoga and Franklin.

The assassins' suspected chief, Rogelio González Pizaña, is also wanted in the United States, where he is accused of threatening agents from the Drug Enforcement Agency at gunpoint in 1999.

Under the plan, anyone possessing 15 grams (about half an ounce) or less would be issued a fine rather than face criminal charges. The government has pledged several times to pass the bill, despite opposition from the United States, but earlier efforts were scuttled when parliamentary sessions ended prematurely.

VALASKA -- BUSH Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, narrowly retained her Senate seat after a bitter battle with her Democratic challenger, Tony Knowles. Mr. Knowles refused to concede defeat, saying there may be thousands of absentee and provisional ballots yet to be counted that could swing the election in his favor, raising the possibility that the final outcome might be fought over for days to come. The contest was one of the hardest-fought and most closely watched in the country because it was considered central to the Republicans' efforts to add to their majority in the Senate. Ms. Murkowski's victory gives the party control of 55 seats, four more than they had going into this election.

VPolice officers in Chinatown were still tending to a man who was slumped and bleeding near a social club on Wednesday night when a second person, a young man in an Internet cafe, was stabbed a few blocks away, the police said. The stabbings, both involving multiple attackers, made for a frantic night for officers and detectives in the relatively placid neighborhood. And yet, investigators say they do not believe that they were related.

VTHE three swaggering young men wear camouflage fatigues and carry rifles at their sides. Stopping briefly at the opening to a wooded trail, they exchange words with a battle-hardened veteran sporting a military-style beret, who offers a gruff word of encouragement. The young men then square their shoulders and step into the forest, bracing themselves for combat. Well, not real combat exactly, but a tournament-level paintball battle, here in the middle of Long Island at Cousins Paintball. And not even a real paintball battle, but a scene staged for the movie camera.

VI can't get the man's cries for help out of my head. ''Please help me, you have to help me, what will happen to my family?'' I tried to get him to calm down, and it didn't work. I simply had to hang up. Then a woman called from her hospital bed at Columbia Presbyterian. She had been unconscious for several days. When she woke up, her friends told her that her husband had been taken by immigration. ''I need him,'' she told me. These tragedies are haunting. I have one client whose parents, ethnic Albanians, fled Yugoslavia before she was born. She's been here for 35 of her 36 years. She was convicted of some drug felonies, went to prison, came out clean and stayed that way. But immigration authorities still arrested her, and she was ordered removed. There are too many of these stories every day. I'm an attorney with the Legal Aid Society, the only free legal-service organization in New York City that provides assistance to people who are in ''removal proceedings,'' what used to be called deportation, because of a criminal conviction. There are crimes people should be deported for -- murder, robbery, rape -- but the way the law is written now, people are being deported for shoplifting or for jumping subway turnstiles or for possession of a joint of marijuana. New York's detainees are held in county jails in New Jersey. There are several hundred immigration detainees in these jails at any given moment. And there's only one Legal Aid attorney available. That's me.

VA 15-year-old girl who escaped from custody Monday morning has been rearrested, the police said yesterday. The girl had been arrested at her home in Coney Island by officers of the Brooklyn Juvenile Crime Squad on a warrant for marijuana possession. When the patrol car stopped about 8 a.m. on Beverley Road, in Kensington, to pick up a second youth, the girl slipped a hand out of her handcuffs, used them to hit an officer and escaped. But on Tuesday, about 11 p.m. two officers from the 60th Precinct spotted her on a Coney Island street and rearrested her. Shaila Dewan (NYT)

V''The Island Lady has taken a vacation from it all,'' Tiffani Ross Parker said, pointing to her painting of a woman reclining seaside under a coconut tree and a hot pink sky. ''She's just chillin' all by herself.'' Ms. Parker, who says she suffers from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, never liked being by herself. When her mother suddenly died in 1992, Ms. Parker, who was 20 at the time, fell apart, reverting to the reckless behavior that cut short her high school education.

VA freelance writer in Alabama, who early this year reported on George W. Bush's activities in Alabama in 1972, contends that Kitty Kelley plagiarized material from his article in her recent best-selling book about the Bush family. The writer, Glynn Wilson of Birmingham, Ala., filed suit last month in Federal District Court there against Ms. Kelley and Random House Inc., accusing them of copyright infringement and asking for a judgment of $5 million.

VIn a case that has spurred intense soul-searching in legal circles, a 25-year-old convicted drug dealer, who was arrested two years ago for selling small bags of marijuana to a police informant, was sentenced on Tuesday to 55 years in prison. The judge who sentenced him, Paul G. Cassell of the United States District Court here, said that he pronounced the sentence ''reluctantly'' but that his hands were tied by a mandatory-minimum law that required the imposition of 55 years on Weldon H. Angelos because he had a gun during at least two of the drug transactions.

VBucking a European trend toward the decriminalization of marijuana, the Italian government proposed legislation that calls for up to 20-year prison sentences for possession of substantial amounts of the drug, regardless of intent to sell. Italians arrested with even small amounts would face punishments, like the confiscation of a driver's license or passport. Under the current legislation, possession of the drug is rarely penalized when it is for personal use, and last year a 17-year-old student convinced an Italian court that the 40 hashish cigarettes he took on a school trip were for his own use.

VLike a lot of New Yorkers, I was gratified to see the Local Conditional Release Commission come under scrutiny last month, though perhaps for a different reason. The commission is a great idea gone horribly wrong. That's not because its erstwhile members freed Guy J. Velella, the former state senator convicted of conspiracy and bribery -- but because they freed so few of the thousands of ordinary people who qualify for conditional release. Indeed, the worst mistake in the Velella episode is the talk of disbanding the commission, not Mr. Velella's early freedom. The solution to the panel's improper procedures and favoritism of late is not the elimination of conditional release, but its expansion.

VTHE EXPERTS' GUIDE TO 100 THINGS EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW HOW TO DO Edited by Samantha Ettus Clarkson Potter, $19.95. THE STREET LAW HANDBOOK Surviving Sex, Drugs, and Petty Crime By Neeraja Viswanathan Bloomsbury, $15.95. EXPERT advice -- along with the careers of experts to dispense it -- has been a publishing success story at least since the 16th century, when 100 years' worth of printing practice yielded not just Bibles and the collected works of William Shakespeare but also a flurry of how-to manuals. I know this only because there's a how-to history, ''How to Do It: Guides to Good Living for Renaissance Italians,'' by Rudolph M. Bell, a history professor at Rutgers (University of Chicago Press, 2000), which traced the history of those giving advice about everything -- from the proper handling of adolescents (who in the 16th century were considered such until the age of 28) to how to conceive a girl (tie a string around one testicle) -- and in so doing revealed much about the concerns of middle-class Renaissance families.

VIT has been more than 30 years since Irene Mock, who grew up on Long Island, celebrated Thanksgiving in November. In Canada the holiday falls on the second Monday in October. And Ms. Mock said she is definitely Canadian. ''I came here to start a new life,'' she said. At a time when more than a few unhappy liberals in the United States are rumbling about moving north -- bombarding the Canadian immigration Web site, fantasizing about Toronto real estate -- Ms. Mock and the expatriates in this town of 9,300 people on a 90-mile-long crystalline lake are proof it can be done.

VA couple and their two sons were among 14 people charged on Friday with being involved in a large drug operation run out of a home on Highland Avenue. The police said the home was raided Friday night after a three-month undercover operation. Lt. Kevin Smith said that drugs were sold openly outside the house and that cars frequently pulled up so purchases could be made. Among those charged were Margaret Major, 42, her husband, Louis Major, 44, and their sons, John, 20, and Louis Jr., 21. The parents and their older son were charged with possession of marijuana.

VIt was a familiar weekend-night call to a suburban police department: a teenagers' party at a nearby house was getting loud and rowdy, and the neighbors wanted officers to investigate. When the officers arrived at the two-story home on Shrewsbury Drive in suburban Livingston, N.J., they said they discovered much of the cause for the raucousness: dozens of open beer containers and several marijuana water pipes in plain view inside the open front door. The smell of marijuana smoke was pervasive, the police said.

VMany kinds of books mean to be instructive. Subjects vary, but at heart they all impart the same basic message: you should be wowed enough to take the book home. But we are so inundated by guides and rules and manuals that we grow ever more difficult to snooker. Sure, there are authors willing to tell you how to date, break up, eat, diet, get rich and keep the wolf from the door. But how many of them have anything genuinely helpful to say?

VAs the N.F.L. and a lawyer for the retired Miami running back Ricky Williams close in on an agreement to allow Williams to be reinstated after serving a substance-abuse suspension at the end of this season, the question remains whether he is interested in returning. Williams's lawyer, David Cornwell, told The Associated Press this week that he was pleased with the league's proposal to allow Williams to serve a four-game suspension in December, then be reinstated with the Dolphins. He also said he thought Williams would be happy with the plan. Cornwell said through a spokesman yesterday that there had been no further progress on the deal.

VWhen Norm Roberts was hired in April as coach of the St. John's University men's basketball team, he surely understood the maxim, ''Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.'' He was profoundly aware of the troubles that that team had recently suffered, yet one of his first rules was a simple one: Don't talk about the past. Roberts, 39, had been an assistant for such respected teams as Tulsa, Illinois and Kansas. But the Red Storm program was an overflowing mess, and not just because of last season's 1-15 record in the Big East and 6-21 over all. It went deeper than winning and losing.

VSt. John's officials said yesterday that a former men's basketball player received cash from an athletic department employee in violation of N.C.A.A. rules, and the university announced that it was imposing two years of sanctions on the men's basketball program. The penalty includes a ban from postseason play this season, a loss of one scholarship in each of the next two years and the return of 90 percent of the money St. John's received for participating in the 2002 N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament.

VTraditional drugs have done little to help Angel Raich. Beset by a nightmarish list of ailments that includes tumors in her brain and uterus, seizures, spasms and nausea, Ms. Raich, 39, says she has been able to find comfort only in marijuana, which was recommended by her doctor. It eases her pain, allows her to rise out of a wheelchair and promotes an appetite that prevents her from wasting away, she said. Her doctor, Frank Lucido, said marijuana was ''the only drug of almost three dozen we have tried that works.''

The first slang word is a variant of ''for sure''; the second, hella, is an adjective meaning ''very, a lot, really,'' perhaps a clip of ''helluva.'' But the word that's sweeping the high-school playgrounds and college campuses is crunk, a blend of ''crazy'' and ''drunk,'' which has elbowed aside wasted, just as faded has replaced stoned. A hard drinker, loud but not yet a crunk, is a daunch. The main interests of high-school seniors and college students include not just drinking, but also sex, reverse peristalsis, superlatives for handsome and ugly, sex, derogations of the stupid, bodily waste, fast automobiles and sex. Accordingly, they create words for these subjects that sometimes last up to three years before they are adopted by adults and then -- as the insider quality of the lingo is lost -- are hurriedly dropped by the originators.

VCAPT. NATHAN ALGREN is a drunken wreck at the beginning of Edward Zwick's stirring epic THE LAST SAMURAI (2003). A Civil War hero reduced to doing promotional talks for Winchester rifles, Algren (Tom Cruise) agrees to take a lucrative overseas job offer. Asked to train the Japanese Army in the ways of modern warfare so they can defeat the Samurai, he answers, ''For 500 bucks a week, I'll kill whoever you want.'' But in the first battle, the Samurai take Algren prisoner, quietly teach him about honor and give him back his soul. When Algren says, ''Every soldier has nightmares,'' his new best friend (Ken Watanabe) replies, ''Only one who is ashamed of what he has done'' -- Saturday at 8 p.m. and Saturday/Early Sunday at 3:35 a.m. on HBO. Mr. Cruise tackled the other side of the coin in BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY (1989), Oliver Stone's potent Vietnam drama. Ron Kovic, Mr. Cruise's character, is a patriotic all-American Long Island boy who joins the Marines and sees things he wishes he hadn't. When Ron comes home to Massapequa, he is paralyzed, but he's still a gung-ho guy until he sees police officers beating antiwar demonstrators. Soon he's expressing his psychological anguish -- ''There's no God! There's no country!'' -- to his parents. After serious reflection during a hedonistic stay in Mexico, where he meets a community of disabled young veterans, Ron finds his activist voice -- Wednesday at 10 p.m. on Spike.

VINTERNATIONAL 3-35 Ukraine's Election Disputed Ukraine's Parliament voted to declare last week's presidential run-off invalid, but failed to set a date for a new election. Parliament does not have the authority to overturn the results, but the vote signaled the swelling dissatisfaction over an election marred by accusations of fraud. 1 Shiites Want January Election Despite calls for a delay in elections scheduled for Jan. 30, Iraq's most powerful Shiite cleric is opposed to the idea, Shiite leaders said, and the main Shiite political parties took the same view. The top American civilian official in Iraq, John Negroponte, also lent his support for the January elections. 1 Assassination Plan in Columbia Marxist rebels had planned to assassinate President Bush last Monday during his stopover in Colombia to meet President Álvaro Uribe, the Colombian defense minister said, without offering details or proof. 26 Standoff on Iranian Research Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi, said the country had every right to keep, for research purposes, some centrifuges that can be used to enrich uranium -- an indication that a standoff on Iran's nuclear program will not be easily resolved. Iran agreed in talks in Paris on Nov. 15 to freeze all its nuclear activities. 14 Pakistan Qaeda Hunt Slowing Pakistan has withdrawn soldiers from the streets of Wana, the main town in a tribal area near the Afghan border, after months of offensives against militants who are suspected of having ties to Al Qaeda. Soldiers are still hunting insurgents in the rest of the tense region. 23 Revamping the United Nations A panel of international figures commissioned by the United Nations Secretary General will publish its recommendations on how to update the Security Council to face such 21st-century challenges as terrorism, nuclear proliferation, poverty, environmental decay and genocide. 26 NATIONAL 37-44 More Borrowing Expected The White House and Republicans in Congress are all but certain to embrace large-scale government borrowing to help finance President Bush's plan to create personal investment accounts in Social Security, according to administration officials, members of Congress and independent analysts. 1 Cultures Clash Among Hunters Many whites from Wisconsin and Asians from St. Paul share a love of hunting. During the traditional November deer season they have often met and sometimes clashed, and some there say they fear those tensions will now only grow after a Hmong man was accused of shooting and killing six hunters. 1 Pinning Hopes on Alpacas The fascination with alpacas, wooly, long-necked cousins of the llama, is gaining momentum. What started as a tiny niche in the world of the domestic livestock market, with a few hundred alpacas imported into this country from South America in the mid-1980's, has grown rapidly in the last several years. 1 Drug Case Before Court The Supreme Court will hear a case that will determine whether patients in 11 states can continue to use marijuana for medical purposes. At issue is whether Congress has the constitutional authority to enforce federal laws in states that allow the use of federally banned drugs. 40 OBITUARIES 56 SCIENCE/HEALTH Churches Try to Prevent Flu The Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington, Vt., is encouraging priests to refrain from using the communion chalice and urging parishioners to avoid the usual handshake, hug or kiss when they make the sign of peace during Mass until the end of flu season, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops said. Other dioceses are taking precautionary measures, a conference spokesman said. 37 NEW YORK/REGION 47-54 A Struggle Between Traditions Afghan women in New York struggle to blend new freedoms and ancient traditions, dealing with issues like hip-hugging pants and arranged marriages, adding a new chapter to an old immigrant story. 47 Word of New Dean at CUNY Matthew Goldstein, the Chancellor of the City University of New York, will recommend Stephen B. Shepard, editor-in-chief of Business Week, as dean of CUNY's new graduate journalism school, according to a journalist involved in the search process who has talked to Mr. Shepard about the appointment. 49 Neediest Cases 54 Chess 54 Weather 57

That, the police said, did not bother Latie Whitley, 34, who lives on East 143rd Street in the South Bronx. Around 12:30 a.m. yesterday, they said, he and a partner were well on their way to successfully defying the conventional wisdom.

VThe Supreme Court is hearing arguments today in a case involving two important, but very different, legal issues: medical marijuana and federalism. Two California women have sued the federal government to stop it from prosecuting them for using marijuana for medical purposes, which they are permitted to do under California law. The court should uphold their right to use medical marijuana, but in a way that pays proper respect to Congress's power to make national laws. This case arises out of an unusually dramatic face-off between federal and state power. In 2002, federal agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration showed up at the home of Diane Monson, who grew marijuana there and used it to treat a degenerative spine condition. In California, such use of marijuana has been legal since 1996, when the voters passed Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act, which allows seriously ill people to grow and use marijuana when a doctor has found it to be medically appropriate. The federal agents were met at Ms. Monson's home by sheriff's deputies, who found that her cultivation and use of the drug were legal under California law. After a three-hour standoff, the D.E.A. agents seized Ms. Monson's six cannabis plants and destroyed them.

VINTERNATIONAL A3-14 Exiting Ukraine President Supports New Elections President Leonid D. Kuchma of Ukraine proposed holding a new election to end the political crisis threatening to tear the country apart, while the country's Supreme Court heard complaints of electoral fraud in the election for president last week. His remarks represented the collapse of what had been a united government position. A1 Iraqi Forces Under Pressure Iraqi police and national guard forces, whose performance is crucial to securing January elections, are foundering in the face of coordinated efforts to murder and intimidate them and their families, say American officials in the provinces facing the most violent insurgency. A1 West of Ramadi, a suicide bomber rammed his car into a group of police officers, killing 12 people, Interior Ministry officials said. In Baghdad, two American soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb, military officials said. The deputy governor of Najaf, along with 30 other Iraqis, was arrested and charged with plotting to kill the American-installed governor, police officials said. A10 U.N. Agency Passes Resolution In a defeat for the Bush administration, the ruling board of the International Atomic Energy Agency passed a mildly worded resolution welcoming Iran's total freeze on a sensitive part of its nuclear program. The resolution removes the possibility that the group will seek censure or even sanctions against Iran from the United Nations. A3 Sudan Orders Aid Officials Out The government of Sudan has ordered the country directors of Oxfam Great Britain and Save the Children UK, two aid agencies that provide relief to displaced people in Darfur, to leave the country, accusing them of statements that the government says suggest support for rebels. A3 China Signs Trade Pact Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China signed a trade accord at a regional summit meeting that calls for eliminating tariffs on a range of agricultural and manufactured goods by 2010, moving the country closer to cementing its economic and diplomatic relationships with Southeast Asia. A9 NATIONAL A15-21 Red Cross Report Cites Prisoner Abuse by Military The International Committee of the Red Cross has charged in confidential reports to the United States government that the American military has intentionally used psychological and sometimes physical coercion ''tantamount to torture'' on prisoners at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. A1 Campuses May Bar Recruiters The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that universities may bar military recruiters from their campuses without risking the loss of federal money. A1 Transfers Raise Flag at Charity The World Jewish Congress, the nonprofit organization that helped force Swiss banks to pay more than $1 billion to settle Holocaust-related claims, is in turmoil over an odd series of money transfers. A21 Judge Voids Libel Suit A federal judge in Virginia has dismissed a libel lawsuit brought by a former Army bioterrorism expert who accused The New York Times and an Op-Ed columnist of implicating him in the unsolved anthrax attacks of October 2001. A21 Justices Skip Gay Union Debate The Supreme Court sidestepped the nationwide battle over same-sex marriage, declining to hear a case aimed at overturning the Massachusetts law that made it legal this year for gay couples to marry. A20 The effort by advocates of the medical use of marijuana to link their cause to the Supreme Court's federalism revolution appeared headed for failure as the justices expressed little inclination to view drug policy as a states'-rights issue. A20 Body Found in Plane's Ruins The body of a teenager believed to be the son of Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports, was recovered from the wreckage of a corporate jet that crashed and exploded Sunday during takeoff from an airport in Montrose, Colorado. A15 Crime in School Declines Crime in the nation's schools fell sharply from 1992 to 2002, part of the broad decline in crime in the last decade, according to a report issued by the Justice Department and the Department of Education. A21 NEW YORK/REGION B1-7 No-Fault Divorce Pushed in New York New York is one of the few states and by some definitions the only state that has not adopted some form of no-fault divorce. But now, matrimonial lawyers, bar associations and even some judges are pushing to have the law changed, saying it is archaic and needlessly heightens hostilities between spouses. A1 Senator Wins 2nd Reprieve A judge ordered Guy J. Velella, a former New York state senator, back to jail, agreeing with the city that a mayoral panel had the power to send him back. But just three hours later an appeals court temporarily put a halt to efforts to put Mr. Velella back in jail, allowing him to remain free until Dec. 16, when five judges will consider his case. B1 Antismoking Effort Faulted An independent review of the New York State Department of Health's $50 million program to reduce smoking found that it has repeatedly failed to spend all of the money available and has been unable to devise an advertising strategy to encourage people not to smoke. B5 Retired Officer Is Indicted A retired New York detective has been charged with manslaughter after his gun discharged in a Queens delicatessen last month, killing a teenage worker, District Attorney Richard A. Brown announced.

D1 BUSINESS DAY C1-16 Merck Adopts Bonus Plan Merck, which has been reeling since it withdrew its arthritis treatment Vioxx from the market after acknowledging that the drug can cause heart attacks, has adopted a plan that will give its top executives a chance for big bonuses if the company is taken over. A1 New Market for Airbus The European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company the controlling shareholder of Airbus, said that its board ''fully supports'' the company's plan to build a competitor to the 7E7, Boeing's ultra-efficient, 200- to 300-seat plane aimed at the market for midsize aircraft. C1 Credit Data, With a Catch Under a federal law passed a year ago, many consumers will be entitled, beginning tomorrow, to a free credit report every year from each of the three big credit-reporting bureaus.

VCrime in the nation's schools fell sharply from 1992 to 2002, part of the broad decline in crime in the last decade, according to a report issued yesterday by the Justice Department and the Department of Education. School crime over that period dropped to an annual rate of 24 violent incidents per 100,000 students from 48 violent incidents, the report found. The figures were based on a nationwide random sample of students who were asked whether they had been victims of crime.

VThe effort by advocates of the medical use of marijuana to link their cause to the Supreme Court's federalism revolution appeared headed for failure at the court on Monday. During a lively argument, the justices expressed little inclination to view drug policy as a states' rights issue by which California and other states that have adopted ''compassionate use'' marijuana measures could displace federal regulation of homegrown marijuana distributed to patients without charge and without crossing state lines.

VAnnie Esposito, the news director at KZYX, the local public radio station, is one of many people here who were not exactly heartbroken when Bruce Anderson, the rapier-witted, acid-penned editor of the weekly Anderson Valley Advertiser, announced that he was moving to Oregon. To Mr. Anderson, the town muckraker and ranter in chief, KZYX was a ''hippie-ding enterprise,'' a symbol of the ''wine-and-cheese gentry,'' the ''lib-lab yuppie hypocrites,'' the ''educrats,'' the ''thumbsuckers,'' the ''New Age barnacles,'' the ''feral enviro-Druids'' and other well-meaning ineffectual ''Nice People'' who flocked to hippie festivals in the early 1970's and stayed.

VA New Man for Commerce President Bush nominated Carlos M. Gutierrez, right, among the most prominent Hispanic business executives in the United States, to be his new commerce secretary. Mr. Gutierrez, 51, has been chief executive of the Kellogg Company, the cereal maker, for five years. PAGE A18 Stress Can Age Cells Researchers have found that severe emotional distress, like that caused by divorce, the loss of a job, or caring for an ill child, may speed up the aging of the body's cells at the genetic level. SCIENCE TIMES, PAGE F5 Under That Ice, Maybe Oil The Arctic Ocean was once apparently a warm basin so rich in sinking organic material that some scientists say the seabed may now hold significant oil and gas deposits. SCIENCE TIMES, PAGE F1 Justices Seem Skeptical On Medical Marijuana In a lively argument on medical marijuana, the Supreme Court expressed little inclination to view drug policy as a states' rights issue. A California court ruled last year that homegrown marijuana distributed to patients without charge and without crossing state lines did not fall within Congress's constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce.

VA federal appeals court has ruled that the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, which operates the transit system in Boston, violated the free speech rights of a group that advocates marijuana use by banning its advertisements four years ago. The court said the authority had engaged in ''viewpoint discrimination'' by rejecting three advertisements from the group, Change the Climate, as the agency did not have the right to reject advertisements because it disagreed with their content. The general manager of the authority, Michael H. Mulhern, said the agency did not allow the advertisements because it felt they were intended for children. Katie Zezima (NYT)

VTo people who have struggled for a lifetime to lose weight, the new drug called rimonabant sounds like a dream come true. It will make a person uninterested in fattening foods, they have heard from news reports and word of mouth. Weight will just melt away, and fat accumulating around the waist and abdomen will be the first to go. And by the way, those who take it will end up with higher levels of H.D.L., the good cholesterol. If they smoke, they will find it easier to quit. If they are heavy drinkers, they will no longer crave alcohol.

VAfter years of false starts, state lawmakers voted Tuesday evening to reduce the steep mandatory prison sentences given to people convicted of drug crimes in New York State, sanctions considered among the most severe in the nation. The push to soften the so-called Rockefeller drug laws came after a nearly decade-long campaign to ease the drug penalties instituted in the 1970's that put some low-level first-time drug offenders behind bars for sentences ranging from 15 years to life.

VAn obituary of the Canadian historian and broadcaster Pierre Berton on Dec. 3 misstated his satirical suggestion for a use of his many books. In a television appearance in October, deriding Canada's anti-marijuana laws, he suggested using them as a rolling surface for marijuana cigarettes, not as rolling paper. The obituary also misstated his birthplace. It was Whitehorse, Yukon, not Dawson City.

VCraig Ferguson arrived at the offices of CBS's late-night entry ''The Late Late Show'' in October, taking up an invitation to serve as a guest host completely as a lark. He had no thoughts other than doing the show that night and then moving on with what had been, to that point, a quirky, reasonably successful show business career.

VSHREWSBURY DRIVE is not the place most people would associate with news of a police roundup. The homes nestled here -- hard by this affluent town's border with West Orange -- are a comfortable mixture of postwar split levels, colonials and ranches, many of them on broad lots, and the driveways are filled with expensive S.U.V.'s. It is a busy suburban road, Shrewsbury Drive, because it offers quick access to Northfield Avenue, a major road thoroughfare that slices through Essex County, and an entrance to Interstate 280. Many of the homes are set back on a hill, near the nature trails that are part of East Hills Park. At the corner of Shrewsbury and Mount Pleasant Avenue, blue-lettered signs warn passers-by that they have entered a drug-free school zone.

VDuring a year that baseball would like to forget, the scene was set for its free fall. Players had testified in front of a federal grand jury about their drug use, revealing the sport's dirty underbelly. In the clubhouses, players could access piles of stimulants as if they were candy, according to the founder of the players union. Major League Baseball wanted a mandatory drug-testing policy, but the players union balked. The commissioner took a hard-line stance, proclaiming, ''We've got to eliminate illegal substances from the game.'' The consequences were grave. Players died because of their drug abuse.

VThey went out late. It was ugly weather. Six below zero in the Brooklyn night. Wind took garbage into the air. A blizzard was in the forecast. It was Lincoln's Birthday, 2003, in Brighton Beach. Not a night for humankind, but the sisters, one 73 and the other 70, didn't get holidays off, didn't get snow days. In years of miserable low points, it was one of the lowest. As they had done the day before and the day before that, Lillian and Julia hobbled out to Coney Island Avenue, a lineup of chromatic storefronts, to beg from strangers in their cars. They were known out there, regulars among the mendicants. The money was for their bilious nephew and his crack habit, their own blood who was smoking up their lives. He had already cost them their house, their savings, their dignity. ''I need one more,'' he would tell them when he desired a hit, ''one more.''

VLast week, Latrell Sprewell became the N.B.A.'s newest exemplar for ''The Player Who Still Does Not Get It.'' In October, when the Timberwolves offered him a $29 million contract extension, he objected to the amount, saying, ''I've got my family to feed.'' It became an infamous catchphrase for a league already battling image issues.

VYOU can call them three graduates of a New York State institution called the Rockefeller drug laws, a system of punishment for drug crimes that is considered among the most severe in the nation. After years of bitter controversy over the laws, the State Legislature voted last week to ease the sanctions, and Gov. George E. Pataki said he would approve the changes. The three were convicted in the late 1980's and early 90's of selling or possessing four to eight ounces of heroin or cocaine, and they were sentenced to minimum terms of 15 or 20 years in prison with the possibility of incarceration for life.

V'The Red Light District' Ludacris What's wrong with Ludacris? Absolutely nothing: the former Atlanta radio D.J. has turned himself into one of hip-hop's most reliably entertaining stars, thanks to a cartoonish shout, a trunkful of spring-loaded beats and a ready supply of shameless punch lines -- he's got ''more rings than your tub.'' Right now, the best way to enjoy Ludacris is in ''Get Back,'' the ridiculous new music video directed by Spike Jonze, who spends four minutes chuckling at one joke: the sight of Ludacris wearing prosthetic Popeye-ish forearms and fists, smashing whatever's in his way -- a pesky fan (played by the hip-hop cult hero Fat Lip), passers-by, an unsuspecting mailbox.

VINTERNATIONAL A3-17 Pinochet Fit to Stand Trial, Judge Rules in Chile A Chilean judge ruled that Gen. Augusto Pinochet was competent to stand trial for human rights abuses that occurred during his 17 years as Chile's dictator and immediately charged him with nine counts of kidnapping and one of murder. The judge also ordered that General Pinochet, 89, be placed under house arrest. A1 9 Dead in Attacks in Baghdad A suicide bomber steered a car full of explosives into the western gate of the protected compound that houses the interim government and embassies in Baghdad, killing at least 9 Iraqis and wounding 19. A second car bomb exploded in northern Baghdad, wounding four people, military officials said. A15 Concerns about harsh techniques used by Special Operations forces prompted the Central Intelligence Agency last year to bar its officers in Iraq from taking part in military interrogations where prisoners were subjected to duress, intelligence officials said. A15 Iran and Europe Open Talks Iran and its European partners pledged to work to overcome their differences and lingering suspicions as they began negotiations for a long-term agreement on nuclear, economic and security cooperation. The largely ceremonial talks flow from Iran's agreement last month to freeze its programs to make enriched uranium. A17 Rights Group Accuses U.S. Human Rights Watch said new cases have come to light of deaths of men in American custody in Afghanistan. It accused the Defense Department of operating outside the law and failing to investigate abuses, including killings. A15 NATIONAL A20-31 Documents Cite Kerik's Links to Crime Figures In June 2000, two months before Bernard B. Kerik was appointed police commissioner, New York City's top investigative agency learned that Mr. Kerik had a relationship with the owner of a New Jersey construction firm suspected of having business ties to organized crime figures, city documents show. A1 Peterson Sentenced to Death After three days of deliberations, and nearly two years of a nationwide obsession, the jury in the double murder trial of Scott Peterson determined that he should be put to death for killing his pregnant wife, Laci, and their unborn son. A20 NASA Chief Vacates Post Sean O'Keefe resigned as NASA administrator, saying he is leaving the job he held for three years to pursue better economic opportunity for his family. A20 Court Backs Defense Lawyers The Supreme Court ruled that faced with overwhelming evidence that a client is guilty of capital murder, a defense lawyer can make a strategic decision to concede guilt in open court, even if the client has not authorized such a strategy. A23 Bishops Said to Abandon Pledge Two victim advocacy groups accused Roman Catholic bishops of abandoning their pledge to root out sexually abusive clergy by reducing the number of dioceses that will receive on-site program audits. A27 D.E.A. Denies School Drug Test A longstanding request to grow marijuana at the University of Massachusetts so it can be tested for medical uses has been turned down by the Drug Enforcement Administration. A25 NEW YORK/REGION B1-7 Pelosi Found Guilty In Murder of Financier Daniel Pelosi, the Long Island electrician who romanced a Wall Street financier's wife to penetrate a world of $10 million townhouses and East Hampton estates was found guilty of murdering his lover's husband, R. Theodore Ammon. B1 Informer May Skip Trial Facing problems with the main informer in a large terrorism financing case, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn suggested for the first time that they might try to prove their case without calling him at all.

VA longstanding request to grow marijuana at the University of Massachusetts so it can be tested for medical uses has been turned down by the Drug Enforcement Administration. The decision was faxed to the university on Friday and made public yesterday by the Marijuana Policy Project, an independent group that favors legalization of marijuana, particularly for medical uses.

VThe New Deal made an unexpected appearance at the Supreme Court recently -- in the form of a 1942 case about wheat. Some prominent states' rights conservatives were asking the court to overturn Wickard v. Filburn, a landmark ruling that laid out an expansive view of Congress's power to legislate in the public interest. Supporters of states' rights have always blamed Wickard, and a few other cases of the same era, for paving the way for strong federal action on workplace safety, civil rights and the environment. Although they are unlikely to reverse Wickard soon, states' rights conservatives are making progress in their drive to restore the narrow view of federal power that predated the New Deal -- and render Congress too weak to protect Americans on many fronts.

V''If there are skeletons in your closet -- from unpaid taxes or debts to a run-in with the law to the messy details of a broken marriage -- you must disclose them to the White House and be prepared for the possibility that they may become public knowledge.'' -- ''A Survivor's Guide for Presidential Nominees,'' November 2000. IN more than two centuries of confirming presidential nominees for cabinet-level posts, the Senate has rejected only nine outright, and none since John G. Tower failed to win confirmation as Secretary of Defense in 1989 after public allegations of womanizing and excessive drinking. Senate vetting of nine more ended without a vote when the nominations were declined or formally withdrawn, like Zoe E. Baird, Bill Clinton's first choice for Attorney General in 1993 and the first to be tripped up by a ''nanny problem.''

V'Valley of Bones' By Michael Gruber William Morrow. 436 pp. $24.95. At the start of what is nominally Michael Gruber's second book for adult readers, a body falls out a window of a Miami hotel. The body winds up on a wrought-iron fence. And it is duly noted that the fence has a French design, so that it features fleur-de-lis spearheads that are convenient for purposes of impaling. As it turns out, this will be one of the book's more quietly contemplative moments. Why is ''Valley of Bones'' only nominally Mr. Gruber's second book for adults, after ''Tropic of Night''? (''The Witch's Boy,'' for younger fans of the macabre, is forthcoming.) Because Mr. Gruber had to spend years telling people that he had seven million books in print and watching their eyes glaze over after he gave them his unrecognizable name. He ghostwrote these books, but they were published as the solo work of his cousin, Robert K. Tanenbaum.

VIf anybody was surprised that Camden was recently ranked America's most dangerous city, it wasn't the people who live here. In the past 12 months, there have been 53 homicides, including a 12-year-old shot to death on his porch for his radio, more than 800 aggravated assaults, including a toddler shot in the back of the head, at least 750 robberies and 150 acts of arson, more than 10,000 arrests and one glaring nonarrest -- a serial rapist on the loose downtown.

VMurders in New York City have dropped, again. So low has the number dipped -- to 566 so far this year from a high of 2,245 in 1990 -- that even Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly has begun to gently lower the public's expectations, warning of a core number of homicides resistant to even New York's gargantuan police force. Low crime rates are more often the stuff of proud news conferences than of intense scrutiny. Yet as street-corner slayings and drug turf drive-bys have melted away, police officials are collecting more data than ever on the remaining few hundred murders, tracking motives, locations, and even the national origin of victims and killers.

VIt happened in November in Montana. Having contracted cancer from his lifelong smoking habit, and suffering from the nausea and loss of appetite that are typical side-effects of chemotherapy, a Marlboro man type (with the blessing of his neighbors, who'd voted to help the ailing old cowboy seek relief from a once-illegal plant) struck a match on his boot heel, cupped the flame, brought it to his lips and lighted a joint. This development surprised some people.

VThe road changes just past the Starr County sign. The shoulder disappears, the grass is left uncut and the black-eyed Susans and big pink Texas sage have to compete with the orange traffic cones set out by the border patrol. Just two counties up from the Texas tip, where the flood plains along the Rio Grande change to rolling hills and eroding cliffs, Starr County, largely Mexican-American, is one of the poorest counties in the nation. Fifty-nine percent of its children live below the poverty level, and in the strange new arithmetic of want, in which poverty means not starvation but its opposite, it is also one of the fattest. In the colonias on the edge of Rio Grande City -- jerry-rigged neighborhoods that are home to many illegal immigrants and lack adequate municipal services -- houses that look as if they might fall down neighbor houses that look like fortresses, a result of the boom-and-bust drug economy. Little gorditos run around in juice-stained diapers, and as the kids get older, they only get fatter. By the time they are 4 years old, 24 percent of the children are overweight or obese; by kindergarten, 28 percent; and by elementary school, 50 percent of the boys are overweight or obese, along with 35 percent of the girls. The concern is not just cosmetic. Overweight children are at significantly greater risk for developing Type 2 diabetes, and by early adulthood, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, colon cancer, breast cancer, gallbladder disease, arthritis and sleep apnea. ''Stop by any time,'' said the local school district superintendent, Roel Gonzalez, inviting me to visit. The child of migrant farm workers, Gonzalez is perhaps the children's greatest advocate and the community's greatest critic. ''I will take you down the hall in any one of my schools, and you will see most of the children aren't slim anymore; they're all beefy. Kids are 30, 40 pounds overweight already, and they're only in high school. We're basically walking time bombs.''

VTwice, she insisted on elective sinus surgery just to obtain more painkillers. Once, she pretended that a flood had ruined her medication so she could get a prescription refilled. There were times when she was so stoned on Percocet that she had no memory of actually singing, a self-described ''junkie'' whom the Metropolitan Opera banished from its stage. Andrea Gruber's tales of addiction pour out like the rich, deep tones of her soprano voice, which again will be heard in the title role of ''Turandot'' at the Met starting tonight.

VBy modern fraternity standards, Phi Delta Theta's tailgate party was a real rager. For one thing, there were kegs. I couldn't see them just then, but proof of their existence was everywhere. Packed into a backyard near the campus of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., were some 100 drunken college students, beer spilling from plastic cups, industrial-size ketchup bottles overturned on the grass near the grill and gaggles of hard-drinking sorority girls (including one self-described Phi Delt groupie) keeping pace with the boys. Amid the revelry, I spotted a lanky, easygoing Phi Delt sophomore from Texas who goes by the nickname Two-Shot, because two shots is about all it takes to get him acting silly. ''Two-Shot!'' I said loudly as he meandered through the crowd in a hooded sweatshirt and jeans, a beer in one hand and a cheap plastic bottle of vodka in the other. ''Where's the keg?''

VIN 22 years of using Bangkok's airport, Don Muang, the busiest in Southeast Asia, I have never known it to be anything but crowded. On New Year's Eve, five days after the tsunami that devastated Phuket and much of the rest of southern Thailand, it was empty. I called friends from the airport, and found that nobody I knew had died; but everyone knew someone who was missing, from every walk of life: businessmen, prostitutes, dealers in marijuana, doctors, politicians. The tsunami made no social distinctions. I was returning from Laos, where my family and I had spent the Christmas vacation by the banks of the Mekong, in the delightful town of Luang Prabang. When we heard the news, my first thought was, ''It could have been us.'' I had originally planned to take us sailing in the Andaman Sea, off Phuket. What chance would we have had in a small sailboat when people drowned in their hotel rooms? We were saved by indolence: I decided to drink Laotian beer by the Mekong rather than face the hassle of sailing.

VBritain's royal family could hardly be described as immune to stumbles and scandals. But even by its standards, Prince Harry -- son of Prince Charles and Diana, the Princess of Wales, grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, third in line to the throne -- has broken new ground. After photographs of him wearing a Nazi swastika at a private fancy-dress party last weekend appeared in The Sun, Jewish groups from Los Angeles to Jerusalem protested, and some people urged him to visit Auschwitz to understand why he caused such offense.

VJewish groups around world protest after British tabloid The Sun runs photos of Prince Harry wearing Nazi swastika at private fancy-dress party; his brief written apology does little to quiet storm of criticism; affront is all the deeper because it comes two weeks before 60th anniversary of liberation of Auschwitz, event that will be observed by other members of royal family, including Queen Elizabeth; incident provokes some introspection about whether memory of death camps has endured across the generations; photo (M)

VOn most days during the last seven months, Lynne F. Stewart, a veteran defense lawyer, has been sitting in a Manhattan federal courtroom, facing trial on charges that she conspired with a convicted terrorist client. But on those days when her case has not been in session, she has turned up in courtrooms elsewhere. In early December she was in federal court in Trenton, for the sentencing of a man who had pleaded guilty to transporting marijuana. For a few hours the defendant Stewart went back to being Lynne F. Stewart, attorney at law, and counsel for an array of wayward and dispossessed -- but fiercely loyal -- clients.

VLIKE many students enjoying the newfound freedom of college, the young man accelerated the drinking he had begun at prep school. ''You go nuts,'' he explains, looking back, seemingly both amazed and disgusted. At 6-foot-1 and 215 pounds, he was able to put away up to 18 beers a night at weekend parties. ''It was crazy,'' says the student, now a junior at Fairfield University, adding that afterward, ''I'd feel like death all day.'' At one party last spring, he drank so much rum that he doesn't remember anything that happened. Other students complained about his behavior and a graduate assistant escorted him to his room. When a campus security guard showed up to talk to him the next day, ''I was still drunk at 3 p.m.,'' he says.

V''EIGHTY-FIVE percent of students drink less than you.'' That's arguably the most disturbing message delivered by e-CHUG, an online service designed to help college students reduce their drinking. Created by three university-based psychologists, e-CHUG is in use at some 110 universities in more than 20 states, according to one of its developers, Douglas J. Van Sickle, director of counseling and psychological services at San Diego State University. Some universities use e-CHUG within a general orientation for new students; others give it primarily to students who have had run-ins with the campus police over liquor. (Students use e-CHUG through their internal university sites, but a demonstration version is available at e-chug.com.) The point is change through self-analysis. Students take an online questionnaire that asks them how much they drink and how much they spend on alcohol in a typical week, whether they've ever been told they drink too much and whether there are any problem drinkers in their family. They're also asked whether their fellow students drink as much as they do. A push of the button, and students get immediate feedback that -- because the database is customized to each university -- allows them to compare themselves with students on their own campus.

VIn Boston, a witness to a shooting by a member of a street gang recently found copies of his grand jury testimony taped to all the doors in the housing project where he lives. In Baltimore, Rickey Prince, a 17-year-old who witnessed a gang murder and agreed to testify against the killer, was shot in the back of the head a few days after a prosecutor read Mr. Prince's name aloud in a packed courtroom.

VKIRSTIE ALLEY ate her way to obesity and gossip-page scorn, but she will return to prime time in March with a show that's more anticipated than anything she has done since ''Cheers.'' Martha Stewart, the paragon of domesticity, will soon reappear on television too, and though she remains stuck at a West Virginia prison, her company's stock went up nearly 7 percent after the announcement of the deal, with NBC. Advertisers are returning to her magazine as they detect a melting of her icy image.

VAT first glance it looked like something in the window of a TriBeCa furniture store, an oversize lamp from the early 60's maybe. But when Kate Chapman flicked a switch and the three-foot high latticework cylinder in front of me began to spin, it was clear that we were dealing with more than just another piece of midcentury flotsam. The machine started to cast strobelike patterns of bright light on our faces, and when I closed my eyes as instructed, there they were, the dazzling multicolored forms that I'd been told about: mandalas and crosses and even Mandelbrot fractals, dancing across my eyelids.

VThe Supreme Court ruled on Monday that in making a routine traffic stop, the police can permit a trained dog to sniff the car for drugs without the need for any particular reason to suspect the driver of a narcotics violation. The 6-to-2 decision set aside a ruling by the Illinois Supreme Court, which held in 2003 that a state trooper who had stopped a man for speeding had broadened the scope of the encounter beyond constitutional limits by having the dog sniff the car. The dog alerted the police to the trunk, which contained $250,000 worth of marijuana. The addition of the dog impermissibly turned a traffic stop into a drug investigation, the Illinois court said.

VFour illegal immigrants from China, two men and two women, were discovered aboard a single-engine private plane that first fled from airborne federal agents and then followed its flight plan and landed in San Antonio. The authorities said after questioning the four that none appeared to pose a security threat and that they had probably paid to be smuggled into the United States to find work. The four are likely to be deported and the pilot, a Mexican, will probably be charged with immigrant smuggling, the police said. The plane was spotted by agents who were pursuing a second aircraft, which they also forced to land, and which was carrying 100 pounds of marijuana. Steve Barnes (NYT)

VCritics say that some death-penalty cases portrayed in ''The Exonerated,'' being shown on Court TV tonight, are not clear-cut instances of the wrongfully accused being cleared. Kerry Max Cook (played by Aidan Quinn, below) THE CASE -- Mr. Cook was twice found guilty and sentenced for the 1977 killing of Linda Jo Edwards. In 1996 the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed his second conviction and ordered another trial, saying that ''prosecutorial and police misconduct has tainted this entire matter from the outset.'' Mr. Cook instead agreed to plead no contest to a murder charge in exchange for time served. THE CRITIQUE -- David E. Dobbs, the prosecutor who handled the 1996 plea deal but was not involved in the earlier misconduct, said the plea accurately reflected the facts. ''He is unequivocally guilty of this crime,'' Mr. Dobbs said. Gary Gauger (played by Brian Dennehy, below) THE CASE -- In 1993 Mr. Gauger was convicted of killing his parents the year before. The trial judge initially sentenced him to death, but later reduced the sentence to life in prison. In 1996 an appeals court ordered that he be retried, ruling that some incriminating statements Mr. Gauger had made during many hours of questioning should not have been presented to the jury because police officers did not have cause to arrest him. Prosecutors instead dropped the charges, and members of the Outlaws, a motorcycle gang, confessed to the murders. THE CRITIQUE -- In 2003 a federal appeals court judge in Chicago, Richard A. Posner, summarized some of the facts in an interim ruling in Mr. Gauger's civil suit for false arrest. ''The absence of signs of forced entry or a struggle,'' he wrote, ''together with Gauger's suspicious behavior and statements, the financial benefit to him of his parents' death (his share of their estate was several hundred thousand dollars), and his acknowledgment that members of the Outlaws motorcycle gang had been occasional customers of his father's motorcycle shop, has left a lingering suspicion that he was somehow complicit.'' Robert Hayes (played by David Brown Jr., below) THE CASE -- In 1991 Mr. Hayes was sentenced to death for strangling a co-worker at the Pompano Harness Track. In 1995 the Florida Supreme Court reversed his conviction and ordered a retrial, saying that some of the DNA evidence used to convict Mr. Hayes was not reliable. ''While evidence exists in this case to establish that Hayes committed this offense,'' the court ruled, ''physical evidence also exists to establish that someone other than Hayes committed the offense.'' At the retrial in 1997, the jury heard evidence that Mr. Hayes's DNA was found inside the victim, Pamela Albertson, and also that hairs found clutched in her hand were inconsistent with those of Mr. Hayes. He was acquitted. THE CRITIQUE -- ''The acquittal on retrial was based on reasonable doubt, not actual innocence,'' said Ward A. Campbell, a supervising deputy state attorney general in Sacramento who has studied cases of people released from death row. Delbert Tibbs (played by Delroy Lindo, below) THE CASE -- In 1975 Mr. Tibbs was sentenced to death for murdering Terry Milroy and to life for raping Cynthia Nadeau, two Florida hitchhikers. The only evidence against him was Ms. Nadeau's testimony. The next year, the Florida Supreme Court reversed his conviction and granted him a new trial, saying there was ''a very real possibility that Tibbs had nothing to do with these crimes.'' Years passed as appeals courts considered whether a retrial should be barred as double jeopardy. In 1982 the United States Supreme Court ruled that a retrial was appropriate. Soon afterward, prosecutors dropped the case. THE CRITIQUE -- Joseph D'Alessandro, a state attorney, told the Florida Commission on Capital Cases in 2002 that Ms. Nadeau ''had progressed from a marijuana smoker to a crack user, and I could not put her up on the stand, so I declined to prosecute.'' He added, ''Tibbs, in my opinion, was never an innocent man wrongfully accused. He was a lucky human being. He was guilty, he was lucky and now he is free.'' ADAM LIPTAK

VIf you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That would appear to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in the New Group's smashing revival of David Rabe's ''Hurlyburly,'' which opened last night at the Acorn Theater on Theater Row. For the pharmaceutically fried denizens of the squalid Hollywood Hills house in which Mr. Rabe's 1984 drama takes place, drugs and alcohol are way beyond recreational status. They're what generate thought and action, love and hate, security and anxiety, often in such a blurred succession of responses that it's hard to distinguish among them.

VThis is probably not the best week to ask Mary Jo Codey, wife of the acting governor of New Jersey, if she wants to spend five more years in a most public life. On Monday, a provocative radio show host made a disparaging remark about her struggle with depression. Her husband, Richard J. Codey, confronted the radio host, yelling that he would like to punch him out. The whole mess landed Mrs. Codey's picture on the front page of The Star-Ledger of Newark, the state's biggest newspaper.

VJONATHAN ROSEN'S novel ''Joy Comes in the Morning'' features a beatific Upper East Side Reform rabbi named Deborah whose days are spent reassuring insecure converts, studying the Talmud and cuddling deformed newborns whose parents have rejected them. This paragon is, we are told, like a ''plant . . . nourishing herself directly from the source.'' But if Deborah is a plant, she's certainly not a clinging vine. When she propositions a man named Lev, it's with a sexy whisper: ''I'm a rabbi, not a nun.'' In contrast, Deborah's Orthodox ex, Reuben, is a Venus' flytrap. Although he wasn't supposed to touch her, he had no qualms about sleeping with Deborah, a slip she's sure was ''only one of the 613 commandments he had violated, but perhaps the one he most easily discounted.'' Curiously, Reuben showed ''more anxiety about the state of her kitchen'' than he did about spending the night -- next morning, he went through the dishes to make sure she had separate sets for milk and meat.

VActing Gov. Richard J. Codey got an earful of what passes for wit on talk radio last week, and it was enough to bring out the feisty side of a politician respected in Trenton for his conciliatory style. On Monday, one of the generic shock jocks on NJ 101.5 radio, Craig Carton, chose as his target women who suffer from post-partum depression -- women like Mr. Codey's wife, Mary Jo. Mr. Carton said the acting governor should support a measure to legalize marijuana for medical use -- Mr. Codey does not -- so that women ''can have a joint and relax instead of putting their babies in a microwave.'' It was a sophomoric reference to Mrs. Codey's admission that she was so ill from depression she considered harming her infants.

VWHAT does regret smell like? To Heather T. Ross, it reeks of a cedar armoire, lovingly restored by a former boyfriend who knew his way around vintage furniture. ''We've all been with someone who is handy,'' said Ms. Ross, 34, founder of Munki Munki, a clothing company in Arcata, Calif. ''It's not until they're out of our lives that we realize how nice it is to have someone who fixes everything.''

VIf he had been onstage, Bob Marley would have waved his graying dreadlocks in the air and beseeched black people to continue struggling. In that lilting voice of his, he would have sung of love, of unity, of his beloved Ethiopia. But Marley was only a memory, albeit a powerful one, at the celebration of the 60th anniversary of his birth on Sunday in the sprawling central square of the Ethiopian capital. So his wife, Rita, his sons, including Ziggy Marley, and numerous other admirers did the singing for the late reggae great, as tens of thousands of people jumped and gyrated to the trademark beat at a daylong concert entitled ''Africa Unite.'' Also performing were the singers Lauryn Hill, formerly of the Fugees; Angélique Kidjo from Benin; and Ethiopian entertainers singing their versions of reggae.

VNo Indie Rock in Libya A little-known indie rock band that had hoped to be the first American group to tour in Libya could not perform because of visa problems, government officials told Reuters. The Heavenly States, from Oakland, Calif., arrived in Libya on Tuesday to play a series of concerts, but could not go on with the tour. ''They came with a tourist visa,'' an official said. The group's singer, Ted Nesseth, said: ''No American band has performed in Libya. There is a certain myth in America about Libya. Part of the reason to come here was to dispel the rumors. I can say it's safer to be here than in Oakland.'' Trouble for Suge Knight Suge Knight, below, the embattled rap impresario, was arrested on Saturday outside Los Angeles on charges of violating his parole after the police said they found marijuana in his truck during a traffic stop, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Knight, 39, was pulled over in Barstow, Calif., for making an unsafe U-turn, and the police searched his Ford pickup. He was also cited for not having insurance. Mr. Knight was released from prison in 2001 after serving time for assault and weapons violations, and recently served 10 months for violating his parole and striking a nightclub valet. New CD Technology First came the CD. Then came the Super Audio CD, then DVD Audio. The newest gourmet audio product is the Dual Disc, a double-sided CD/DVD hybrid -- with regular CD audio on one side and enhanced sound plus multimedia goodies on the DVD side -- that was introduced late last year. Sony BMG has been slow to join in with Dual Discs, but it plans to catch up fast tomorrow by issuing 18 of them, including classical albums by Yo-Yo Ma and Joshua Bell, evergreen reissues like AC/DC's ''Back in Black'' and Miles Davis's ''Kind of Blue'' and recent albums by Destiny's Child, Avril Lavigne and John Mayer. New releases of regular old CD's tomorrow include the boudoir-soul singer Brian McKnight's ''Gemini'' (Universal), the rock band 3 Doors Down's ''Seventeen Days'' (Universal), the country singer Lee Ann Womack's ''There's More Where That Came From'' (Mercury Nashville) and the Irish band the Frames' ''Burn the Maps'' (Anti). A big series of Herb Alpert reissues on Shout! Factory starts tomorrow with three albums, ''The Lonely Bull,'' first released in 1962; ''South of the Border,'' from 1964; and ''Lost Treasures: Rare and Unreleased.'' Dutoit Extends Contract Charles Dutoit has signed a contract extension with the Philadelphia Orchestra that would keep him the artistic director and principal conductor of the orchestra's summer series at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center through 2008. Mr. Dutoit, 68, the former music director of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, has led the summer season in Philadelphia since 1990.

VThe star witness in the prosecution's case against Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chief executive of WorldCom, took the stand yesterday and directly connected Mr. Ebbers to the accounting fraud that brought down the company in 2002. ''Bernie had a grasp of financial information that surpassed the level of chief operating officers and even some chief financial officers at companies we were acquiring,'' the witness, Scott D. Sullivan, WorldCom's former chief financial officer, said in Federal District Court in Manhattan.

VIN person, Craig Carton, the talking head accused of the verbal crime of gubernatorial-wife-bashing, is Bambi-eyed, motor-mouthed, polite and more saccharine than expected. Preconceived impressions to the contrary, he does not froth at the mouth. Or maybe he saves that for his radio broadcast. Mr. Carton reveals that his mother and his wife consider him ''a slob,'' that on-air talk ''triggers something'' in him and that he thinks of himself as ''a good guy.'' Charitable, even. If there was a calendar of comely male radio hosts, February's offering might show Mr. Carton in the guise of Mr. Misunderstood. Cue up a big sigh.

VNo one prosecuted the war on drugs in the Texas Panhandle more zealously than Richard James Roach. As the blustery and hot-tempered Republican district attorney for five counties overrun with methamphetamines, he had eked out an election victory in 2000 vowing a crackdown and was soon gleefully reeling off the harsh sentences he had wrung from juries: 36 years, 38 years, 40 years, 60 years, 75 years -- even 99 years. ''I think it's quite clear that the good citizens of this district are fed up with drugs,'' he said. He had barely missed riding the issue to victory in an earlier race. ''My campaign is centered around doing something with the dope dealers,'' he told a local newspaper in 1996, complaining that ''it's kind of hard to fight drugs when you've got dirty law enforcement.''

VDespite all the advances of modern medicine, the main drugs used to fight pain today are essentially the same as those used in ancient times. Hippocrates wrote about the pain-soothing effects of willow bark and leaves as early as 400 B.C. Opium was cultivated long before that. Aspirin and morphine, based on the active ingredients in these traditional remedies, were isolated in the 1800's and helped form the foundation of the modern pharmaceutical industry.

VIn his first day under cross-examination, Scott D. Sullivan, the government's star witness in its case against the former WorldCom chief executive, Bernard J. Ebbers, said yesterday that he had lied dozens of times to auditors, directors and shareholders. Mr. Sullivan's testimony in Federal District Court in Manhattan came in response to a blizzard of questions from a defense lawyer, Reid H. Weingarten, who has been trying to show that Mr. Sullivan -- and not Mr. Ebbers -- masterminded the $11 billion fraud that led to the collapse of WorldCom in 2002.

VA transit worker on a routine inspection shortly before 3 a.m. yesterday found a plastic bag containing two human legs and an arm beside the tracks of the southbound A train in Bedford-Stuyvesant, the police said. Last night, the police identified the victim as Rashawn Brazell, 19, of Bedford-Stuyvesant. He was identified after the police traced a fingerprint to an arrest for possession of marijuana, the only arrest on his record. Investigators could not say whether Mr. Brazell had been reported missing before the discovery of the remains, or how long they had been at the tracks. Another bag, containing tools, drill bits and what appeared to be blood, was found near the remains, investigators said, but it was unclear whether the two discoveries were connected. Neighbors at Mr. Brazell's apartment building said that he worked at a clothing store in Manhattan and lived with his mother and stepfather. He was last seen by his family on Monday, a neighbor said. Before his remains were found, the police had been seen searching the building, neighbors said. Michael Wilson (NYT)

VTHERE is a slightly illicit thrill that comes with stepping inside an arcade, and this remains true long after you're old enough to know that more dangerous places exist. Perhaps it is the strange interior light, which has the dim quality of a backroom gambling hall. Or maybe it is the complete loss of the temporal world, of hour or minute, day or night. Chinatown Fair, an arcade on Mott Street, is such a teenage netherworld, the kind of place that erases the span between 1985 and 2005. The interior is dark and subterranean and noticeably absent of grown-ups. Occasionally, the air thickens with the smell of marijuana smoke. Among the rows of blinking contraptions are a startlingly realistic shootout game called Time Crisis 3; two pinball machines; a photo booth; no fewer than a dozen fighting games; and an ancient wooden box that measures sexual attractiveness on a scale of ''blah'' to ''uncontrollable.''

VAs George W. Bush was first moving onto the national political stage, he often turned for advice to an old friend who secretly taped some of their private conversations, creating a rare record of the future president as a politician and a personality. In the last several weeks, that friend, Doug Wead, an author and former aide to Mr. Bush's father, disclosed the tapes' existence to a reporter and played about a dozen of them.

VDoug Wead, author and friend of Pres Bush, reports that he recorded phone conversations when Bush turned to him for advice at beginning of national political career from 1998 to 2000; says he recorded conversations because he viewed Bush as historic figure, but he knew Bush might regard his actions as a betrayal; has played about a dozen tapes that offer insights into Bush's thinking as he contemplated run for presidency; private Bush heard on tapes sounds remarkably similar in many ways to public Bush; photo (M)

VJOSHUA BENEDEK, a University of Connecticut student home on summer break in July 2003, was planning for that sloppy American rite of passage, the 21st birthday party. Finally of legal drinking age, he considered holding court at a bar and flashing identification that could suddenly fetch a beer or a shot of tequila with no questions asked. But several of his friends were not yet 21, the Horace Greeley High School graduate said by phone from college, and he decided to have a party at the family home instead.

VIn Julian Fellowes's urbanely funny novel ''Snobs,'' an accountant's daughter named Edith buys a ticket to visit the ancestral home of Charles, the Earl Broughton. This is an inauspicious way for them to meet, but Charles winds up proposing marriage. ''Flower shows all summer, freezing pipes all winter'' says Charles's sister, describing what Edith's new life will be like. ''Does she hunt?'' No, she doesn't yet -- not unless Charles counts as prey.

VCORNELIUS JOHNSON came to New York from Jamaica in 1993. As a legal resident, he settled in upstate New York with his extended family. In 1997, he was arrested for criminal possession of marijuana and spent a few days in jail. In an agreement with the state, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to time served. Neither the lawyer nor the judge mentioned that in accepting a plea bargain, he could be deported. And guess what? Today, eight years after the conviction and with a clean record, Mr. Johnson faces mandatory deportation. Cornelius Johnson's case is emblematic of a plea bargaining system in New York that is unfair to immigrants. When plea bargaining works, it works well: In exchange for a reduction in charges, a defendant pleads guilty, eliminating the expense and uncertainty of a trial for both him and the state. But there's one big problem for defendants in New York's immigrant community: Unlike many other states, New York does not inform immigrant criminal defendants that part of what they bargained for may include deportation.

Cornelius Johnson's case is emblematic of a plea bargaining system in New York that is unfair to immigrants. When plea bargaining works, it works well: In exchange for a reduction in charges, a defendant pleads guilty, eliminating the expense and uncertainty of a trial for both him and the state. But there's one big problem for defendants in New York's immigrant community: Unlike many other states, New York does not inform immigrant criminal defendants that part of what they bargained for may include deportation.

VIT could have been just a vanity production, but Fred Schepisi's IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY (2003), which stars Michael Douglas, his son Cameron and his parents, Kirk and Diana Douglas, is actually a charming portrait. The two adult Mr. Douglases play affluent New York lawyers who get together for Passover and rub each other the wrong way. After all, Michael Douglas's character is the kind of driven man who will answer his cellphone during the Seder in the middle of the Four Questions. There is a death in the family, a suspected infidelity and a drug bust. Bernadette Peters plays Michael Douglas's wife, a psychiatrist who describes her own children as ''weird, very weird.'' Their younger son is played by Rory Culkin -- Friday at 7 p.m. and Saturday at 4:35 p.m. on Showtime. Clint Eastwood's line ''There's nothing like a nice piece of hickory,'' after he beats several men with one, is not exactly ''Go ahead, make my day,'' but then in PALE RIDER (1985) he was still shaping his tough, enigmatic western image. Mr. Eastwood plays a mysterious, nameless preacher who comes to the aid of a 19th-century California mining community being terrorized by a rich man's henchmen. Two women (Carrie Snodgress and Sydney Penny, playing mother and daughter) fall in love with the preacher, who is astonishingly good with guns for a man of God. Michael Moriarty plays the local nice-guy wimp by whose weaknesses the preacher's courage is measured. Mr. Eastwood directed -- Friday/Early Saturday at 3:30 a.m. and Saturday at 10 a.m. on TNT.

VORDER is awfully overrated. The most human of instincts, it seems to exist largely to banish -- or at the very least, to corral -- any whiff of the chaotic. Take, for example, the following sentence: Waht does tihs guy tihnk he's donig? Even haphazardly spelled, the words make sense to most people. So waht's the big deal?

VYing Yang Twins Let's say you're a successful (but not quite respected) hip-hop duo from Deacatur, Ga. -- two guys who do nothing but yell about sex. How do you prove your versatility? You release a single called ''Wait'' (TVT), in which two guys do nothing but whisper about sex. Over a sly, muted beat, the rappers unleash one hissed proposition after another. It's crude, gimmicky, unnerving and strange -- which is to say, perfect. Tweet It's been 2 years, 10 months, 3 weeks and 6 days since this R&B singer released ''Southern Hummingbird,'' a remarkable debut album full of elegant slow jams and woozy electronic beats. If you can't wait until March 22, when her new album is due, you can visit tweetmusic.com to hear the new single, ''Turn da Lights Off,'' produced by Kwame -- the same forgotten-rapper- turned-memorable-producer responsible for ''On Fire,'' by Lloyd Banks. For this seduction song, Kwame echoes the singer's flickering urges by toying with an old Luther Vandross record: speeding it up, dragging it to a halt, even running it backward. Mary Gauthier On ''Mercy Now'' (Lost Highway/Universal), this weathered country singer and storyteller unfurls one lovely narrative after another, chronicling a merciless world in which it's always a little bit too late to change your mind. ''Falling Out of Love'' follows an ex-lover who's suffering an outlaw's fate, condemned to keep moving, and ''Your Sister Cried'' (written by Fred Eaglesmith) is simpler and spookier: ''Your sister cried all the way home,'' she sings, again and again, as if she can't get the image out of her head. Krayzie Bone This hip-hop pioneer invented a sing-rapping style that has influenced everyone from Usher to Nelly. All he got was this lousy career: his group, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, suffered a long (and totally undeserved) slide into obscurity. Now comes ''Gemini: Good Vs. Evil'' (Ball'r/BMG), Krayzie Bone's third solo CD. This one is less weird and less ambitious than 2001's mournful ''Thug on da Line,'' but it's still a joy to hear Krayzie unleash his fast and flexible sung rhymes, especially on ''Get'chu Twisted'' (produced by Lil Jon) and ''Chaos Interlude,'' which is 90 seconds of apocalyptic verse. Krayzie Bone also appears on ''Bone Brothers'' (Koch), the new album by two other Thuggers (it seems a better nickname than the alternative), Layzie Bone and Bizzy Bone. Here's hoping that the inevitable Bone Thugs-n-Harmony reunion album isn't merely a return to form but a return to the charts, too; if they have any sense of decency, musical descendants like Nelly will be more than happy to lend a hand. M. Ward This singer and strummer from Portland, Ore., records songs that are sometimes enthralling, sometimes slight and sometimes, somehow, both at once. His new album, ''Transistor Radio'' (Merge), errs on the side of slightness: it consists of 16 little compositions that seem more hummed than sung, including a Carter Family cover, ''Oh Take Me Back.'' Still, Mr. Ward has a lovely rasp, frayed and exquisitely soft, and he lets it out like steam -- this is 43 minutes of not-so-heavy breathing. Steven 'Lenky' Marsden Dancehall reggae is slumping, but someone forgot to tell Mr. Marsden, who recently cooked up yet another thrilling electronic riddim: ''Bubble Up,'' a brisk track with rubbery synthesizers and a crisp backbeat. Sean Paul uses the riddim for ''We'll Be Burning,'' a breezy marijuana tribute; Danny English's ''It Deh Ya'' lays gruff vocals over the sparkling beat; and Elephant Man outdoes himself with ''It Sweet Me,'' which grafts a fluttering synthesizer line over the beat to create a huge, daft chorus. Visit unitysounds.com to buy vinyl singles of all the tracks. My Chemical Romance Emo is in its own slump (after the feeding frenzy of 2003), but someone forgot to tell this wild-eyed New Jersey band, which just released yet another absurd video for yet another grand, death-obsessed love song. In ''Helena'' (watch it at mychemicalromance.com), the singer Gerard Way presides over a carefully choreographed punk-rock wake: a church full of mourners twirl and tumble in time to the frantic beat.

VIf the last two hours of Gina Gionfriddo's ''After Ashley,'' which opened last night at the Vineyard Theater, were as fine as the first 15 minutes, we'd have a new play worth cheering about. As it is, the spark of interest ignited by the fresh opening moments is all but extinguished by the time this finger-wagging satire has concluded. That promising first scene is set in a messy middle-class family room occupied by a mother and her teenage son. Justin (Kieran Culkin), home from school with mononucleosis, slouches in an armchair with a look of queasy disgust on his face. It's not just the fever. The prescriptions for self-improvement issuing from the talk show his mother is intently watching are also making his skin crawl.

VA 52-year-old former minor league manager who is bracing for his second baseball season in court says he cannot afford to pay $500 for his freedom. Leon Lee has decided that the price is simply too steep. Five hundred dollars might end a criminal case against him, but Lee says it would not restore his name or bring back the career that is his life.

VIn the middle of a snowstorm on a deserted Queens street early yesterday, an intoxicated teenager punched and kicked to death a 52-year-old Guyanese immigrant returning home from his job as a school bus mechanic, the police said. The police and Queens prosecutors said that the teenager, Antonio Roque, 18, fatally beat the man, Jagat Ram Balram, about 12:30 a.m. as he was preparing to enter the three-story walkup on Jamaica Avenue in Richmond Hill where he lived with his wife, Dhamrajie, 48, and their 21-year-old son, Hardeo. A passer-by saw Mr. Balram lying on the snowy sidewalk between a parking meter and a heavy iron support for the J train, which runs on an elevated track over the avenue.

VINTERNATIONAL A2-6 Freed Italian Journalist Fired on by U.S. Soldiers American soldiers guarding a checkpoint in Baghdad fired on a car carrying a kidnapped Italian journalist who had just been freed, wounding the journalist and killing an Italian intelligence agent. The military said the car approached the checkpoint at a high speed and soldiers tried to signal it to stop, including firing warning shots. A1 Two newly elected politicians announced they were withdrawing from the political alliance put together by Iraq's most powerful Shiite cleric, representing the first notable fracture within the alliance. The split signaled that any talks to form a new government would probably be protracted, as rivals try to take advantage of rifts in the alliance. A6 Syria to Assemble Parliament Syria said its president, Bashar al-Assad, would convene a session of Parliament to deliver a speech, raising expectations that he would announce a partial pullout of Syrian troops from Lebanon in an effort to ease the growing international pressure on his government. A5 Ex-Ukraine Minister's Suicide Ukraine's former interior minister, a man suspected of involvement in the abduction and murder of a prominent journalist in 2000, died in a cottage outside Kiev in what officials called a suicide. Yuri F. Kravchenko shot himself in the head hours before he was supposed to meet with prosecutors to be questioned for the first time in the case. A3 U.S. Yields to Global Opposition The United States bowed to global opposition at a United Nations conference on women's equality and dropped its insistence on inserting an anti-abortion amendment into a document that was then adopted unanimously. A5 Restitution for Nazi Seizure A German court ruled that the heirs of a once-prominent Jewish-owned department store chain were entitled to compensation for what has in recent years become one of Berlin's most valuable pieces of real estate. The decision resolved one of the biggest and most bitterly disputed claims for restitution of property seized by the Nazis. A6 NATIONAL A7-10, 14 Bush Tries to Reinvigorate Social Security Campaign Stepping into a rapidly escalating battle for public support, President Bush tried to jumpstart his uphill drive for personal Social Security accounts, insisting the retirement system required a ''drastic'' change and challenging skeptics to put their own ideas forward. A1 Scientist Picked for E.P.A. Post President Bush nominated Stephen L. Johnson, a scientist who rose through the ranks during a 24-year career at the Environmental Protection Agency, to be the agency's administrator. A1 Marijuana Violence on Border The shooting death of four officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who were searching a marijuana growing operation in Alberta highlighted the expanding and increasingly violent marijuana trade along the Canadian border. A1 Accuser Praised Jackson In a videotape produced two years ago by aides to Michael Jackson, the boy he is charged with molesting said the singer was a ''loving, kind, humble man.'' A7 Of Democrats and Abortion Robert P. Casey Jr., Pennsylvania's Democratic state treasurer and a strong opponent of abortion, announced that he will run for the U.S. Senate next year. Gov. Edward G. Rendell, a fellow Democrat, endorsed Mr. Casey. A14 Religion Journal A10 SCIENCE/HEALTH Cancer Drug's Benefit Debated A federal advisory panel began wrestling with whether to remove from the market a lung cancer drug that was approved for use by desperate patients but has failed to prolong lives in a large clinical trial. A8 F.D.A. Seizes Millions of Pills Angered by quality-control problems it said had dragged on for more than two years, the Food and Drug Administration used armed federal marshals to seize millions of tablets from plants operated by the drug giant GlaxoSmithKline. A7 NEW YORK/REGION B1-6 Arrests Made in Murders Of Jersey City Family Two former convicts were charged with binding, gagging and cutting the throats of four members of an Egyptian Christian family last January in what prosecutors called a robbery that went awry in their Jersey City home. While the brutal killings appeared to have the characteristics of a hate crime, the authorities stressed that it was a bungled robbery, not the result of religious enmity. Jury Is Stymied in Shooting After five days of deliberations in the trial of a police officer who killed an unarmed man, the jury said in a handwritten note to the judge that they were deadlocked. The judge is expected to order them back to deliberations. B1 Severed Hands Reattached In a rare procedure, surgeons at Stony Brook University Medical Center simultaneously reattached both of a Long Island man's hands after they were accidentally sliced off while he was operating a vacuum form machine at a factory in North Bay Shore.

A11 ARTS B9-19 Bolshoi Theater Reconstruction The main building of the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow will close on July 1 for a long-anticipated reconstruction, the general director of the house said.

VTwenty years after a federal law took effect authorizing the United States to penalize countries that do not control illicit narcotics production, the same countries, by and large, are producing large quantities of heroin, cocaine, marijuana and other drugs, according to the State Department's annual drug-trafficking report, published Friday. The United States has been providing anti-narcotics aid to more than a dozen nations for more than two decades -- roughly $1 billion a year in recent years. Each year the government reports large-scale eradication of crops and seizures of illicit drugs. But this year, as every year, reports of progress are overwhelmed by the weight of the problem.

VThe drugs move across the Canadian border inside huge tractor-trailer rigs, pounds and pounds stashed in drums of frozen raspberries, tucked in shipments of crushed glass, wood chips and sawdust, or crammed into hollowed-out logs, in secret compartments that agents refer to as ''coffins.'' Kayakers paddle them south from British Columbia across the freezing bays of America's northwest corner, and well-paid couriers carry up to 100 pounds at a time in makeshift backpacks, hiking eight hours over the rugged mountainous terrain that forms part of the border between the United States and Canada. Small planes drop them onto raspberry fields and dairy farms in hockey bags equipped with avalanche beacons to alert traffickers that the drugs have landed.

They all have their own reasons for holding this offbeat, part-time job for 16- and 17-year-olds -- trying to get a convenience store cashier to sell them cigarettes illegally, with an undercover tobacco enforcement officer watching and waiting to pounce.

VAT two o'clock on a chilly January morning, about 80 people were crammed cheek by jowl into Nublu, a tiny club in the East Village, to see a performance by Brazilian Girls, the club's de facto house band. Nublu is one of those definitively downtown places, a chic oasis hidden behind an unmarked storefront. The room was packed with stylish young men and women -- white, black and otherwise -- speaking a babel of languages. In center of the scrum (Nublu has no stage) was the slinky figure of Sabina Sciubba, Brazilian Girls' frontwoman, singing ''Die Gedanken Sind Frei (Thoughts Are Free).'' The song's lyric was lifted from a 13th-century German poem; a bassline pulled the song toward the spacey languor of dub reggae; various electronic blips drifted up through the mix; Ms. Sciabba's talk-singing nodded both to hip-hop and Weimar cabaret. Stepping into Nublu from the winter cold, it was possible to believe you'd arrived in the world's hippest musical melting pot.

VEARLY Friday morning, one of America's most celebrated prison inmates, Martha Stewart, walked through the doors of the Federal Prison Camp in Alderson, W. Va., to the great delight of her fans. Her release has people asking a pertinent question: What, precisely, are prisons for? When I arrived at the Maxwell Federal Prison in Montgomery, Ala., in the summer of 1974 in the wake of Watergate, I was greeted by a burly caseworker who seemed undaunted that he was processing the former special counsel to the president. ''Just remember one thing, Colson,'' he said. ''The reason you are here is to be punished.''

VJustice Minister Irwin Cotler criticized judges for being too lenient in sentencing people charged in Canada's marijuana drug trade, calling the illegal industry ''a scourge.'' The marijuana industry in Canada is estimated to be worth $7 billion, with drugs increasingly being produced in large, sophisticated growing operations run by criminal organizations and smuggled into the United States. Mr. Cotler told CBC radio that the government would move ahead with plans to double prison sentences against marijuana growers, to as many as 14 years from 7, as part of legislation that would also decriminalize the personal possession of small amounts of the drug.

VThe rap diva Lil' Kim took a legal gamble yesterday by testifying in her own defense in her federal perjury trial, saying that ''I did the best I could'' before a grand jury in 2003 but that she had felt intimidated by a prosecutor. The rap star, whose real name is Kimberly Jones, surprised prosecutors by taking the stand at midmorning, testifying for three and half hours. Speaking about her grand jury appearance, she said she had not wanted to identify a friend because she was not certain he was the man in a photograph she was shown.

VLil' Kim, the rap artist, was heading to Los Angeles to perform at the Black Entertainment Television awards, so she dropped $500,000 worth of jewelry into a handbag. Their value came to light when Lil' Kim lost track of the bag at Kennedy International Airport and several pieces were stolen. The rap diva, whose real name is Kimberly Jones, recovered them later that day in June 2003. But a prosecutor in Ms. Jones's federal perjury trial showed yesterday that at the same time Lil' Kim was flashing diamonds and living high off earnings of at least $750,000 a year, she owed almost $1 million in back taxes to the Internal Revenue Service. She reported to the I.R.S. that the jewelry she owned was worth only $49,000.

VIN mid-2002, when the video game Narc was only six months into development, the most startling element in it may have been a barrel-throwing sumo wrestler. Or it may have been the inclusion of a villainous flamenco dancer named El Toro. When the game is released for PlayStation 2 and the Xbox next week, however, the most arresting aspect will most likely be that players of Narc will -- as part of the gameplay -- be able to take drugs.

VBurton Kaplan, 71, had a long career in the garment industry. He traveled to Hong Kong for his wholesale clothing business. He had a warehouse on Staten Island. He worked hard, according to some people who knew him, and raised a family. A diminutive man in horn-rimmed spectacles, he appeared to live a quiet, unexceptional life. But Mr. Kaplan, it turns out, had other business interests -- namely, drug dealing. He worked hard for many years, prosecutors said, smuggling heroin, cocaine and tons of marijuana into New York. That lucrative sideline earned Mr. Kaplan, at 64, a retirement to be spent behind bars. He was sentenced in 1998 to 27 years in federal prison, in effect, a life term.

VI'm on a grand jury. We've been given cases involving someone who views pornography on his computer behind locked doors and someone caught in the presence of marijuana. The assistant D.A. indicates that I shouldn't abstain from voting, but my conscience won't let me sleep if I make felons out of such people. May I vote not to indict? L.D., Fountain Hills, Ariz. Ethically, you may. Legally, it's debatable. The attorneys I consulted were not unanimous, but most agreed that, unlike petit jurors, who must convict if the evidence warrants, grand jurors ''are entirely free to charge what the government proposes, to charge differently or not charge at all,'' as Claudia Conway, a capital defender with New York's Legal Aid Society, put it. And so, without disavowing the marijuana law, for example, you might honorably find it not applicable in this case. Another option you've overlooked: indict not for a felony but for a lesser charge.

VRoland G. Fryer Jr. is 27 years old and he is an assistant professor of economics at Harvard and he is black. Yes, 27 is young to be any kind of professor anywhere. But after what might charitably be called a slow start in the scholarly life, Fryer has been in a big hurry to catch up. He was in fact only 25 when he went on the job market, gaining offers from -- well, just about everywhere. He abruptly ended his job search by accepting an invitation to join the Society of Fellows at Harvard, one of academia's most prestigious research posts. This meant he wouldn't be teaching anywhere for three years. The Harvard economics department told Fryer to take its offer anyway; he could have an office and defer his teaching obligation until the fellowship was done. Now that he is halfway through his fellowship, the quality and breadth of Fryer's research have surprised even his champions. ''As a pure technical economic theorist, he's of the first rate,'' says Lawrence Katz, a prominent labor economist at Harvard. ''But what's really incredible is that he's also much more of a broad social theorist -- talking to psychologists, sociologists, behavioral geneticists -- and the ideas he comes up with aren't the 'let's take the standard economic model and push a little harder' ideas. He makes you think of Nathan Glazer or William Julius Wilson, but with economic rigor.'' Henry Louis Gates Jr., the Harvard humanities scholar, says that Fryer is ''destined to be a star. I mean, he's a star already, just a baby star. I think he'll raise the analysis of the African-American experience to new levels of rigor and bring economics into the mainstream area of inquiry within the broader field of African-American studies.''

VI love tacky souvenirs, but occasionally give in to good taste. I shall always regret, in particular, one that I did not buy. It was in Hammerfest, in northern Norway, and the object in question was made of a reindeer hoof, the toes (or whatever you call them) painted white to serve as big buckteeth. There were eyes of those sort of googly things with the pupils that roll around and some kind of antlers. It may have been an ashtray, or a pincushion, or a toast rack. It was appalling and hilarious, and I mourn it to this day. An informal survey of kitsch-loving friends and acquaintances has revealed that almost all of them remember an object pined for but not attained. Lewis Marshall, for example, an Episcopal priest, was recently delighted to find that the 1960's lived on in Eugene, Ore., as witnessed by a hemp-upholstered toilet-seat cover decorated with an embroidered marijuana leaf. He reconsidered after his partner asked him if he'd lost his mind.

VAT the Congressional hearings last week investigating steroids and baseball, players were scolded not just for taking substances that are unsafe, but for doing something immoral. Those who use performance enhancing substances were called cheaters, cowards, bad examples for the nation's children. But if baseball players are cheating, is everyone else, too?

VTHE Plaza put me off marzipan forever. The hotel and I were formally introduced in the late 1950's by my mother, who, holding securely to my white-gloved hand, regularly led me under the portico, up the stairs and into the lobby for afternoon tea at the Palm Court. An indefatigable shopper, my mother often spent Saturdays with her two little girls in tow on a marathon spree from B. Altman to Lord & Taylor to Best & Company to Saks Fifth Avenue and finally to Bonwit Teller and Bergdorf Goodman, where looking for party dresses seemed interminable since the saleswomen only showed them one by one.

VFive men were charged in Federal District Court in Brooklyn yesterday with operating a wholesale marijuana cultivation and distribution ring out of three sites, including two near elementary schools. Peter Zuccaro, Michael Lezamiz, Leonard Palone, Joseph Iorio and Harry Gabor were charged with operating the indoor hydroponic growing scheme, which employed 15 people and had grossed nearly $12 million since 1997, according to the office of Roslynn R. Mauskopf, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, and District Attorney Denis Dillon of Nassau County. One of the growing warehouses was across the street from Public School 109 in East Flatbush, and another in the basement of Mr. Lezamiz's home in Bayside, Queens, opposite St. Robert Bellarmine School, the authorities said. Mr. Zuccaro, whom the authorities identified as the ring's leader, is in federal prison in Florida on an unrelated conviction, and is to be brought to New York next week for arraignment. The other four pleaded not guilty at their arraignments last week, the authorities said. All except Mr. Lezamiz were ordered held without bail. He was released on $5 million bail.

VWhitney Houston in Rehab Whitney Houston, below, has checked back into a drug rehabilitation program a year after first entering a program for substance abuse, Reuters reported. It was not immediately clear where the singer was seeking treatment or when she went in. Ms. Houston, 41, first checked into a rehabilitation center last March after a string of canceled appearances and erratic behavior. In an interview with Diane Sawyer on ABC in 2002, Ms. Houston admitted to using marijuana, cocaine, alcohol and prescription drugs, but said that a spiritual adviser had helped her stop. Scholarships From a Critic When Harold C. Schonberg, below, the former chief music critic of The New York Times, died, in 2003, he established in his will a $5 million trust to support piano students at four major music schools: Juilliard, Mannes College of Music and the Manhattan School of Music in New York, and the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. The trust, established through the estate of Schonberg and his wife, Helene, who died shortly before him, is to be used for scholarships at the four schools, primarily for piano students, although the schools are free to award the money as they see fit, said Jay H. McDowell, a lawyer at the law firm of Withers Bergman, who is a trustee of the fund. The fund will distribute 5 percent a year to the schools, divided equally, Mr. McDowell said. Representatives of Juilliard and Curtis said they expected to begin awarding the money to students in the fall. Crowe's Final Grunt Russell Crowe's rock band, 30 Odd Foot of Grunts, has not always been well received; in a review of its last album, Blender magazine said Mr. Crowe's lyrics ''run the gamut from mundane to embarrassing.'' Now it is apparently defunct. In a posting on the band's Web site announcing the completion of a new album, Mr. Crowe, above, said the band ''would seem to have dissolved/evolved.'' In his posting, Mr. Crowe said he was disappointed about the end of the band but now enjoys ''the joy of writing unrestricted.'' Footnotes Jerry Springer's new radio talk show, ''Springer on the Radio,'' which he began in January in Cincinnati and has taken to a handful of markets around the country, will now be heard on the Air America network on 51 stations and on both Sirius and XM satellite radio. It will be broadcast from 9 a.m. to noon each weekday beginning April 1. Leonard Slatkin has been given a newly created post by the Los Angeles Philharmonic: principal guest conductor at the Hollywood Bowl, the orchestra's summer home. The two-year assignment begins this summer. ''I Wanna Be Loved by You,'' the Brooklyn Museum's exhibition of 200 photographs of Marilyn Monroe, right, by 39 photographers, has been extended through April 3 -- by popular demand, the museum said. Brandeis University is renaming its annual Brandeis Festival of the Creative Arts, for Leonard Bernstein. Now called the Leonard Bernstein Festival of the Creative Arts, it will run this year from April 13 to 17. Bernstein taught there from 1951 to 1955, and in 1952 created the festival, whose first season had the premiere of his one-act opera ''Trouble in Tahiti.''

VCongregation Fails To Evict Tenant An eviction battle in New York City is hardly unusual, but the tenant-versus- rabbi twist in this one got it public attention. In 2000, a Hasidic congregation, Bnai Abraham Mordechai, bought a five-story town house on East 38th Street in Manhattan, between Madison and Park Avenues, and moved to evict four tenants. Three left, but the fourth, Vicki Ross, was determined to remain in her rent-stabilized, $1,090-a-month, one-bedroom apartment, her home for 25 years.

VThe Supreme Court in recent years has drawn constitutional rules for the use of newly popular law enforcement techniques. The police need a warrant before aiming a heat-detecting device at a private home in an effort to find out whether marijuana is growing inside under high-intensity lights. The police do not need a warrant before permitting a trained dog to sniff a car, or a piece of luggage at an airport, in order to detect drugs. Those precedents converged in a case from Texas that posed this question: Can the police bring a trained dog to stand outside a private home and sniff for drugs?

VEric Robert Rudolph, the former fugitive who evaded capture in the North Carolina mountains for more than five years, has agreed to plead guilty to bombings that killed two people and injured more than 150 others at abortion clinics and at the 1996 Olympics here, the Department of Justice said on Friday. As part of his plea agreement, Mr. Rudolph revealed the whereabouts of more than 250 pounds of dynamite and of a buried bomb more than twice as powerful as the one that went off here in Centennial Olympic Park, the authorities said. The explosives were recovered and disposed of this week. In exchange for the information, Mr. Rudolph, 38, will serve life in prison instead of facing possible execution.

VThe French police returned a stolen painting by Picasso yesterday to the Pompidou Center in Paris. The 1924 Cubist oil on canvas, ''Nature morte à la Charlotte,'' valued at $3.2 million, disappeared from one of the museum's warehouses, and a complaint was filed in March 2004. Investigators discovered that a 32-year-old guard had given his marijuana dealer access to the building, and that the dealer had carried out the theft. He passed the painting to a third man, who confessed to hiding it behind a cabinet in his house on the outskirts of Paris, where the police found it in good condition on Tuesday. ''I don't think they realized what the value of this painting was,'' said Catherine Driguet, a Paris police spokeswoman. ''They deal drugs, not stolen artworks.'' The investigation is continuing.

VIt came at the end of a hectic nine-stop campaign swing through upstate New York, when a tired, irritated Robert Abrams called Alfonse M. D'Amato ''a fascist'' -- and with that Mr. Abrams's campaign seemed to go off its rails. For all the time and money he had put into his run for the United States Senate, for all his years as the state's popular attorney general, Mr. Abrams's campaign in 1992 became defined largely by that one comment. Fernando Ferrer is facing a similar problem in his run for mayor this year. Mr. Ferrer stepped into the campaign for mayor confident that the primary was his to win. Then he made remarks about Amadou Diallo, the unarmed African immigrant killed by the police in 1999. Mr. Ferrer said the shooting was not a crime.

VLove is not an emotion. No one needs protection from the vagaries of life, because life ''is an experience, not an attack.'' There is no heaven, there is no hell, and it's not important to know whether God exists. These important revelations in ''Winning Girls Through Psychic Mind Control,'' which opens today at the Two Boots Pioneer Theater in the East Village, come from the mouth of Samuel Menendez, the drummer in a struggling lounge act, but not from his brain. Ever since Sam (Ruben Santiago-Hudson) listened to an audiotape titled ''Winning Girls Through Psychic Mind Control'' in a hotel room one night, he has been possessed by four wise entities. They speak through one voice, which refers to itself as the Conductor.

VNo one else can leer quite like Alan Cumming. He perfected the expression on Broadway, playing the M.C. in ''Cabaret,'' and has been known to show it off even in wholesome family entertainment like ''Annie.'' The occasional leer is worth waiting for in Showtime's musical version of ''Reefer Madness,'' but more often Mr. Cumming is wearing a smirk. That look is appropriate enough for Mr. Cumming's character, the Lecturer, who has come to speak to a group of small-town parents about the evils of ''a vile narcotic, an unspeakable scourge, the real Public Enemy No. 1'': marijuana.

V8 p.m. (Showtime) REEFER MADNESS (2005). It's not the camp 1930's propaganda film about the evils of marijuana. This new musical version has Alan Cumming, Neve Campbell, wholesome high school sweethearts destined for corruption (Christian Campbell and Kristen Bell, above) and a touch of "Night of the Living Dead." 7:30 p.m (5) SEINFELD "The Outing." Some people become convinced that Jerry and George are gay -- "not that there's anything wrong with that." 8 p.m. (7) LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE -- The darker, scarier version of Laura Ingalls Wilder's frontier family reminiscences continues. Tonight part 4 of 5), Indians move into the neighborhood; with Kyle Chavarria (right). 8 p.m. (Animal Planet) EUKANUBA TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS -- Dogs, dogs, dogs. 8 p.m. (BBC America) 2005 BRIT AWARDS -- These music prizes were presented in London in February. Performers include Green Day, Snoop Dogg, Franz Ferdinand, Joss Stone and the Scissor Sisters. 9 p.m. (13) HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING (1967). Robert Morse, straight from Broadway, stars in the stirring musical tale of a window washer's ascent of the corporate ladder. With Michele Lee, Rudy Vallee and Frank Loesser's rousing score, including "I Believe in You" and "Brotherhood of Man." 10 p.m. (Cinemax) ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND (2004) -- Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet (above) play mismatched lovers who decide, individually, to have all memories of their relationship erased. But some love affairs just refuse to end. Charlie Kaufman, Michel Gondry (the director) and Pierre Bismuth won the original- screenplay Oscar. 11:05 p.m. (13) GREAT PERFORMANCES -- ''Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma!'' Yes, it's the wildly acclaimed London stage production with Hugh Jackman as Curly. Too bad he never played the role here. Broadway theatergoers got "The Boy From Oz" instead.) ANITA GATES

VIT was described as a remote and stunning drive to the east end of Molokai. It might more accurately have been described as a drive to the end of the earth. On a staggeringly beautiful morning in February, the soft sunlight shimmering through the Hawaiian mountains, we set off on the 26-mile drive to the trailhead of a hike through the overgrown Halawa Valley, where low stretches of stone walls stand as the only archaeological evidence of the seventh-century settlement of temples and the taro patches that once thrived there. Our Jeep followed a road that snaked along the beach, practically hugging the surf, before lifting us into the mountains and dropping us in the valley. We never encountered another vehicle, and just as well: For the final seven miles, the road dwindled down to a narrow single lane before just conceding to nature and turning into a dirt trail.

VLast fall, I traveled to Woody Creek, Colo., to talk to Hunter S. Thompson for what turned out to be one of his final interviews. For years, Thompson had been trapped in the persona he created in his 30's, forever forced to play Hunter S. Thompson. More than drugs, this was the monkey on his back: he was frozen in the role of the insider's outsider, on call for every would-be rebel who wanted to party with the madman. At the end, he was writing a column for ESPN.com and the occasional article, but mostly he was just being Hunter S. Thompson, a show that began each night in his house outside Aspen at around 5 with the first stirrings of bedsheets. A groan. A string of expletives. An assistant who hurries into the kitchen like an emergency room nurse. ''He's awake! He's awake!'' On my first night, the TV was turned to ''Monday Night Football,'' a tall glass was filled with ice cubes and Chivas Regal, and a path was cleared to his chair at the kitchen counter -- the same chair where, a few months later, on Feb. 20, he would kill himself with a pistol shot, bringing to a climax his long relationship with guns. Thompson was among that group of American writers who knew how to be young but never figured out how to grow old: F. Scott Fitzgerald and Jack Kerouac and Eugene O'Neill, who died in a Boston hotel, thousands of dollars in debt. (''Born in a hotel room and, goddamn it, died in a hotel room,'' he said.)

VTHE MADONNA OF EXCELSIOR, by Zakes Mda. (Picador, $14.) Based loosely on apartheid's ''immorality trials'' (in which South Africans were prosecuted for miscegenation), this lyrical, unsparing novel explores the shared cultural history of an Afrikaner settlement and its adjoining black township. Niki, a black woman left destitute by the trials, earns money posing as the Madonna with her mixed-race daughter for a white artist. Mda, a South African playwright, follows his characters through 30 years of their country's history, deftly weaving issues of racial identity, rape and revenge. Our reviewer, Neil Gordon, praised Mda as a ''writer who can seduce us through beautiful language and unfailing humor'' and ''has the power to shock and frighten us.'' FREE CULTURE: The Nature and Future of Creativity, by Lawrence Lessig. (Penguin, $15.) In this powerfully argued appeal, Lessig, a professor at Stanford Law School and a crusader against the expansion of copyright protections, looks at the shrinking of the public domain and the threat to innovation this poses.

VI. Justice Thomas's Other Controversy If you think back to Clarence Thomas's Supreme Court confirmation hearings in 1991, what most likely comes to mind are the explosive allegations of sexual harassment made by the law professor Anita Hill. Years from now, however, when observers of the court look back on the hearings, they may well focus on a clash that preceded Hill's accusations -- an acrimonious exchange that few remember today.

VThe Supreme Court added an important new religion case to its docket on Monday, agreeing to decide whether the government can ban the importation of a hallucinogenic tea that is central to the religious rituals of a small Brazil-based church. The case raises the broader question of how the court will interpret, in the context of an illegal drug, a law that ordinarily requires the federal government to refrain to the maximum extent possible from interfering with religious practices.

VPrime Minister Paul Martin is scrambling to keep power as the scandal involving his Liberal Party grows, making deals that delay or even jettison central elements of his political agenda, including a bill to legalize same-sex marriages and a measure to control greenhouse gases. Less than a year after the Liberal government was elected, the House of Commons has virtually ground to a halt as leaders of Canada's four political parties, sensing the imminent fall of the government, have begun campaign posturing for elections that are rumored for June. Mr. Martin, it seems clear, hopes to delay elections until fall, expecting that public anger will cool by then.

VGrant Roberts, who was once a highly regarded pitching prospect in the Mets organization, was among nine players suspended for 15 games yesterday for violating baseball's minor-league steroids policy, raising the total this year to 47 players. Roberts, a 27-year-old right-hander, was removed from the Mets' major-league roster in November, then went to spring training with the team with a minor-league contract. He appeared in one spring-training game, pitching a scoreless inning March 6 against Washington, then was released by the Mets on April 14.

VNew York police officers and federal agents have dismantled a Harlem marijuana ring that was grossing $10 million to $15 million a year and was responsible for as many as seven murders, law enforcement officials said yesterday. The ring, called Two Mile Posse after the area of Jamaica where many of the members came from, had been in operation for 10 years, the police said.

VWhen artists turn a hand to furniture, the results are usually not for the timid. This small show of five pop-oriented artists from different generations makes the point with Yayoi Kusama's silver-painted stool covered with pop-up phalluses. And -- more orderly if not as pretty -- Tom Sachs's ''Bong Station,'' a rough-hewn console organized in compartments to contain the licit and illicit: a mirror, an electric clock, a machete, a remote-controlled toy racing car, cigarettes, a beer can, a water bottle and a bong (for marijuana). But there are more decorous works, too, like Roy Lichtenstein's dashing chair and ottoman of painted bronze (above), formed from several heroic blue and black brushstrokes, and Ed Ruscha's highly lacquered five-panel wood screen, painted on both sides with dreamy atmospheric cloud drifts. They carry lines in block lettering from an Elvis ballad: ''I Forgot to Remember to Forget'' on one side, ''I Remembered to Forget to Remember'' on the other. Jeff Koons is seen here at his most minimal, with a trio of simplified wall-mounted floral cut-outs of mirror-finish stainless steel, each having a different-colored center, cutesy but not very Koons-y. Artists doing furniture is by no means a new phenomenon, and given more room, the gallery could undoubtedly have provided many other examples. But in this case, the show's intimacy adds to its punch. (Leo Castelli, 18 East 77th Street, Manhattan, (212)249-4470, through May 27; free.) GRACE GLUECK

VThe family dinner has long been an example of family togetherness. But recently, scientists have been coming up with compelling reasons -- including a lowered risk of smoking, drinking and doing illicit drugs among teenagers -- for families to pull up a chair around the table. The interest in the ritual may have been spurred by concerns that the number of families who do not dine together is increasing. According to several surveys, 30 to 40 percent of families do not eat dinner together five to seven nights a week, though most families eat dinner together some days a week.

VIt was late September when the 21-year-old man, fresh from a three-week commitment in a psychiatric ward, showed up at an Army recruiting station in southern Ohio. The two recruiters there wasted no time signing him up, and even after the man's parents told them he had bipolar disorder -- a diagnosis that would disqualify him -- he was all set to be shipped to boot camp, and perhaps Iraq after that, before senior officers found out and canceled the enlistment. Despite an Army investigation, the recruiters were not punished and were still working in the area late last month.

VThe worst case of overacting at a recent performance of Dan Israely's ''Orgasms'' at the SoHo Playhouse was in the audience. Two women to my right were either employed by the management as professional laughers or under the influence of some dangerous new recreational drug (maybe some of that super-fast-acting marijuana from ''Reefer Madness''). Or they were just odd. One found the strangest lines hilarious -- including ''Let's take a simple situation'' -- and laughter was not enough to express her delight. She continually clapped like a child watching a magician at a birthday party, sometimes calling out ''Yes!'' to dialogue that particularly pleased her. This was all very strange, since there isn't a single genuinely funny line in this overlong one-act would-be comedy.

VThe M35 bus at night is a place of weary faces and empty pockets. It runs from Spanish Harlem to the largest men's homeless shelter in the city. Every night, men file on to get to a place to sleep. Sometimes they pay the $2 fare; sometimes they don't. Other riders have recently appeared, still scruffy but with a different goal. They are undercover police officers, there to arrest fare-beaters.

VFederal prosecutors in Brooklyn charged eight people yesterday with operating a marijuana smuggling ring between Arizona, several southeastern states, and the New York City area. The prosecutors said the arrests were part of a wider investigation, conducted by agents from United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, that has resulted in charges against 20 people. The prosecutors said the ring smuggled a potent form of marijuana, which was sold for as much as $2,200 per pound. They said about 100 pounds of the marijuana was sold between November 2004 and last month. Federal agents also seized $50,000 in cash, prosecutors said.

VThe father of one of two second graders found dead in a park here was charged Tuesday with first-degree murder, less than a month after he was released from a Texas prison for the latest in a number of assaults over more than a decade. The father, Jerry B. Hobbs, 34, could face the death penalty in the beating and stabbing deaths of his 8-year-old daughter, Laura, and her best friend, Krystal Tobias, 9, who had spent Sunday riding around this working-class town on Laura's bicycle, flying kites and tossing a football with their friends.

''We're now approaching life and the year as if the Dave Chappelle show doesn't exist, because it doesn't,'' said Doug Herzog, president of Comedy Central. ''We don't know what to plan for, so we're not planning for it. I keep on telling my guys that we're now the San Francisco Giants, and Barry Bonds, our cleanup hitter, is not available.''

VAt 5 a.m. yesterday, as the sky began to brighten over Washington Square Park, Schuberto Juan Solis's 21st birthday celebration came to an end. After a night of revelry, he and several friends started back toward New Jersey. ''I haven't been out this late in a long time,'' said David Menaken, one of the friends. They were not alone.

VWashington Square Park, Greenwich Village's freewheeling home to chess players, marijuana dealers, college students and guitar-bearing bohemians, has become cleaner in recent years. (It's much cleaner than it was in the early 19th century, when it was used for public hangings.) Now a $16 million redesign plan calls for more changes, including new landscaping and a four-foot-high granite and wrought iron fence around the perimeter. One afternoon last week, some park users said they liked the plan. Some had their own suggestions. But most had more personal things on their minds. SETH KUGEL

VThe N.B.A. announced yesterday that no further labor talks would be scheduled after it canceled a meeting on Tuesday. That move was in response to a proposal the union sent to the league late last week. ''Since we are at a loss as to how we can possibly reach a new deal that is in any way consistent with the principal terms that we have been discussing for many months, there are no further meetings scheduled at this time,'' Russ Granik, deputy commissioner of the N.B.A., said in a statement.

VWhen more than 17 million of the nation's television households last saw Zach Young, the sullen teenager burdened by secrets on the ABC show ''Desperate Housewives,'' he was being abandoned, or so it seemed, by his sinister father. It was the latest blow in a plot that began with his mother's baffling suicide and continued with his father's descent into murder. Yesterday, however, real life itself took a distressing turn. The police announced that Cody Kasch, 17, the actor who plays Zach, had been arrested on a charge of smoking marijuana in public on an East Village street. Mr. Kasch was released by the police and has returned to his home in California.

VARE diamonds really forever? Sure, they're tough and everything, a perfect 10 on the Mohs scale and the signifier (in jewel-ese) of eternal love. But what with a recent fashion joy ride courtesy of two words -- bling bling -- ice may soon find itself likened to more ephemeral delights: sex, fame, InStyle magazine. Beautiful tonight, but will you still sparkle in the morning?

VIT is not what you might expect to see first when you fly halfway around the world for an authentic indigenous Australian experience: a cemetery. But there it is, a large cemetery sign at the entrance to the Titjikala Aboriginal community 75 miles south of Alice Springs in the scorching Outback, where flies sometimes seek moisture in your mouth -- people tend to talk with pursed lips -- and a thin layer of red dust envelops you.

VSix Brooklyn men described as members or leaders of a violent gang responsible for five killings and for attempts to kill police officers were indicted yesterday on charges including racketeering and murder, the police and federal prosecutors said. The charges cover shootings that date to 2000, mostly involving members of rival gangs. One, on Oct. 14, 2001, was directed at a gang member inside a fast-food restaurant in Brownsville; he survived, but the restaurant's manager was killed, according to a statement issued by the United States attorney in Brooklyn, Roslynn R. Mauskopf. The other slaying victims were gang members, prosecutors said. ''This is not simply a tale of rival gang members killing each other over turf,'' John Klochan, the acting assistant director of the F.B.I. in New York, said in a statement. ''Nothing gets our attention quicker than conditions that threaten the life and safety of police officers and innocent bystanders.''

VA drug smuggling case that has captivated and outraged Australia came to a climax on Friday when a 27-year-old Australian woman was given a 20-year prison term for trying to bring nine pounds of marijuana into Bali hidden in her bodyboard bag. The verdict, read in a packed courtroom in Bali, was carried live on Australian television and radio. The three judges who heard the case could have sentenced the defendant, Schapelle Corby, to death, a fate met by many foreigners convicted of drug offenses in Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries.

V8 P.M. (4) THE EAGLES IN AUSTRALIA -- The group, which made its name in the 1970's, plays its big hits, including "Hotel California" and "Desperado," and new songs in what the band (above, from left, Timothy B. Schmidt, Joe Walsh, Don Henley and Glenn Frey) is calling its Farewell 1 Tour. Taped in Melbourne. 6 P.M. (Science) UNDERSTANDING: LAUGHTER -- This episode delves into laughing patterns, what makes a joke work and how the brain processes humor. 8 P.M. (11) BEAUTY AND THE GEEK -- The women are good-looking but not that academically accomplished. The men are really smart but lack social skills. This new reality series pairs them up to try to remedy each other's shortcomings. There will be a spelling bee, a rocket-science exercise, dancing classes and massage lessons. 8 P.M. (TCM) STEVE McQUEEN: THE ESSENCE OF COOL -- Yes, he was, in films like "The Thomas Crown Affair," "The Sand Pebbles" and "The Great Escape," right up until his death in 1980. McQueen (shown with Jacqueline Bisset in "Bullitt") would have turned 75 this year. 9 P.M. (7) DANCING WITH THE STARS -- Pair a celebrity with a professional ballroom dancer, put them into training, then have them compete with similar pairs. Trista Sutter ("The Bachelorette"), Rachel Hunter and Evander Holyfield are among the famous participants, who, in the first episode, will try the cha-cha and a waltz. 9 P.M. (TNT) THE CONTENDER (2000) -- Joan Allen stars as a United States senator nominated for vice president who finds herself embroiled in a sex scandal (something about a party she attended in college). 10 P.M. (Comedy Central) SOUTH PARK -- In "Die, Hippie, Die," first shown in March, Cartman (left) tries to warn the townspeople that college- educated, know-itall marijuana-smoking hippies may soon infest South Park. Sure enough, Hippie Jam Fest 2005 is soon under way and Cartman will have to do something drastic. 10 P.M. (Bravo) SPORTS KIDS MOMS & DADS -- This eight-episode series follows five young people who have decided to go for the gold in their respective sports (football, basketball, figure skating, riding and cheerleading) and the parents who encourage, inspire, push and live through them.

VThe practical Dutch rarely like the idea of following idealistic French initiatives, but this time everything suggests that they, too, will reject the European constitution in their referendum on Wednesday, albeit for different reasons. Here the issue appears to be less fury at the government and more unhappiness at the direction the European Union has been taking in recent years, above all since it adopted a single currency and expanded eastward, taking in 10 new members.

VJust after dawn on a recent Saturday at Waikiki Beach, when the crowd for a surfing meet was already growing with early risers, Derrick Ontai walked along the beach and scanned the sparkling blue horizon for a southern swell for the morning's competition. His own board was not waxed and ready for the next heat. Mr. Ontai, 19, was more concerned with making sure that next to the judges' booth, a prayer tent was set up. There, not only could he pray for waves, but he could also pray for other surfers to find Jesus.

VA high-speed police chase that was followed by a gun battle in Brooklyn last night left a uniformed police officer wounded and a drug suspect dead, apparently by his own hand, the police said. The police officer, who was hit by two bullets that punctured his lower abdomen and forearm, was saved from graver harm by the Kevlar vest he was wearing, which deflected another bullet from his chest, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said at a briefing for reporters at Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center. The officer, Patrick Caprice, 42, underwent surgery there and was listed in stable condition early this morning.

VThe Indonesian Embassy in Australia closed Wednesday after a package arrived containing a white powder that Prime Minister John Howard said was ''some kind of biological agent.'' Mr. Howard linked the case to public anger in Australia over the conviction last week of a 27-year-old Australian woman, Schapelle Corby, on charges of smuggling marijuana into Bali. Ms. Corby filed an appeal on Wednesday.

VWho Needs Netflix? The New Jersey International Film Festival has provided adventurous movie programming in New Brunswick every summer for each of the last 10 years. This summer, film fans can hunker down in the dark with their popcorn and watch 25 films through Aug. 18. Included in this group are nine winners of the competitions that are an integral part of the festival, as well as several revivals and international and independent films. Those wishing to make movies of their own can also participate in five film workshops (assuming they register fast -- the workshops are always a sellout). The festival was founded by Albert Nigrin, executive director of the Rutgers Film Co-op/New Jersey Media Arts Center, which sponsors the event along with the Rutgers University Program in Cinema Studies and Eastman Kodak. ''Seven or eight of our films are beating their New York premieres,'' he said, adding that the festival's educational component is what makes it unique. ''We try to give as much education as possible,'' he said. ''Our mission is to make more New Jersey filmmakers.'' Several students from have gone on to show their work on television or in the movies, he said, and one former participant is currently shooting a film with Andy Garcia.

VA surveillance video shows that the partner of a police officer who was shot three times during a car stop last week in Brooklyn ran away and, for several minutes, failed to help the wounded officer, a police official said yesterday. The actions of the partner, Officer Gilberto T. Marrero, are under investigation by the Police Department's Firearms Discharge Review Board as part of its routine inquiry into the shooting, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is still under way.

VAdvocates of medicinal uses of marijuana suffered a legal setback on Monday in the United States Supreme Court, but there was little panic or despair amid the tears of disappointment. ''Just because we lost this little battle does not mean that the war is over,'' Angel McClary Raich, one of the marijuana users whose case was before the Supreme Court, said at a news conference here. She added: ''We're just sick. We're not criminals.''

VThe Supreme Court on Monday upheld the power of Congress to prohibit and prosecute the possession and use of marijuana for medical purposes, even in the 11 states that permit it. The 6-to-3 decision, a firm reassertion of federal authority, revealed a deep fissure within the coalition that over the past decade has provided the majority for a series of decisions curbing Congressional power and elevating the role of the states within the federal system. Two members of that coalition, Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Antonin Scalia, voted this time to uphold federal authority.

VSupreme Court, in 6-to-3 decision, upholds power of Congress to prohibit and prosecute possession and use of marijuana for medical purposes, even in 11 states that permit it; majority bases its decision on power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce; those voting to uphold federal authority include Justices Anthony M Kennedy and Antonin M Scalia, who over past decade have voted with majority in series of decisions curbing Congressional power and elevating role of states within federal system; this decision overturns 2003 ruling by federal appeals court that shielded California's Compassionate Use Act, medical-marijuana initiative adopted by state's voters nine years ago, from reach of federal drug enforcement; decision is not necessarily last word on medical marijuana from courts or other branches of government; under terms of opinion, appeals court will now consider other challenges to application of federal drug law; advocates for medical marijuana emphasize that state laws remain in effect, and that prospect of federal enforcement is fairly remote; photos (M)

VWe read the Supreme Court's decision on the medicinal use of marijuana with mixed emotions. We certainly wish that the Justice Department could be weaned from the gross misuse of the federal Controlled Substances Act that led to its campaign against the use of marijuana by terminally ill people in the 11 states where it is legal for doctors to prescribe it. But we take very seriously the court's concern about protecting the Commerce Clause, the vital constitutional principle that has allowed the federal government to thwart evils like child labor and segregation. The dissenters in the 6-to-3 decision, Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Clarence Thomas and Chief Justice William Rehnquist, opened the door for conservatives who want to sharply reduce Congress's use of its power to regulate and protect interstate commerce. These conservatives want to turn the clock back to before the New Deal, when workers were exploited, factories polluted at will and the elderly faced insecure retirements.

VThe melee at the Academy at Ivy Ridge, a boarding school here for troubled teenagers, began at about 10:15 p.m. on May 16 when someone pulled a fire alarm in the boys' dormitory. Within moments, students were smashing windows, overturning furniture and fighting, with some trying to help the academy's security guards squelch the disturbance. Eleven students fled the campus, near the Canadian border, and bolted into the night.

VRELIEF for medical marijuana patients was snatched away this week. In Gonzales v. Raich, the Supreme Court ruled that such patients will be subject to federal prosecution even if their own state's laws permit use of marijuana. Now, short of Congress legalizing medical marijuana, the only way that its users can avoid stiff financial penalties or jail is if it is turned into a prescription medicine approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Justice Stephen G. Breyer said as much during oral arguments last November with his comment that ''medicine by regulation is better than medicine by referendum.'' Fair enough. The problem is that the very agencies integral to facilitating the research and development of medical marijuana have actually been impeding progress.

VA police officer who was shot last week while chasing a suspect said yesterday that he was grateful for the support he has received from the New York Police Department and the staff of Brookdale Medical Center. Standing in the lobby of his apartment building in Crown Heights with a bandage on one arm, and leaning on a metal cane, Officer Patrick Caprice, 42, said he was still recovering from the June 1 shooting in Brownsville. He was shot five times by David Redden, 18, whom the officer and his partner chased after they saw him buy marijuana, the police said. Officer Caprice, who spoke to reporters yesterday for the first time since the shooting, said he was particularly grateful to Officer Gwen Johnson and Sgt. Anthony Carter, who arrived first after he was shot and scooped him into a police van. ''Without thinking, they took me straight to the hospital,'' he said. ''Without them, I'd be dead right now.'' He declined to say anything about his partner, who the police said fled when Mr. Redden opened fire. Michelle O'Donnell (NYT)

VTo the Editor: The Supreme Court's decision on the medicinal use of marijuana (''Justices Say U.S. May Prohibit the Use of Medical Marijuana,'' front page, June 7) is a severe blow to cancer patients and others with debilitating diseases who desperately need a measured, alternative form of pain relief. Simple compassion mandates that patients at the end of their rope -- or life -- should be afforded the means to find some peace from their pain.

VWILL the Rehnquist Court's federalism revolution outlast the Rehnquist Court? If Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist retires this summer, as appears likely, the court's ruling last week that federal drug law trumps states on the use of medical marijuana will be its last word on federal-state relations during his tenure.

VAngela Whitiker arrived early and rain-soaked at a suburban school building with a carton of sugar water in her purse and a squall in her stomach. It was the small hours of the morning, when the parking lot was empty and the street lights were still on. There she was alone in the darkness for the biggest test of her life. If she passed, she could shed the last layer of her former self -- the teenage girl who grew up too fast, dropped out in the 10th grade, and landed aimless and on public assistance with five children by nearly as many men.

VI AM not one of the ''seriously ill Californians'' that Proposition 215, the state's medical marijuana law passed by voters in 1996, was designed to help. I'm a 31-year-old marathon runner who's generally in peak health, unless I've had a few too many margaritas. But two months ago, I decided to read Proposition 215 to find out just how sick you had to be to obtain marijuana legally. I made a startling discovery. The state health code listing the conditions for which marijuana can be recommended by a doctor includes migraine right after AIDS, cancer and glaucoma. Every month or so, I get a migraine headache from dehydration or the stress of a deadline. Although I had a hard time believing someone like me might qualify as a medical marijuana patient, there it was in cold print.

The appeal had attracted widespread attention as the most potent of several efforts around the country to make the case that Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce did not extend to protecting animal or plant species that lack commercial value and that live in only one state.

So said his agent, Leigh Steinberg, earlier this week in a news flash that launched a thousand mental images of Williams, the yardage-yeoman-turned-yogi, speeding east on a black ribbon of asphalt and burning lavender incense while Bob Marley blared from his car speakers. The truth is more mundane. The phantom of the N.F.L. is being a family man.

But I knew that because I worked at home, I would be the one waiting all day for an electrician who had promised to come between 9 and 12. Finally I said to Tim: "Listen, maybe you just don't understand. What I want is a penthouse apartment with a large terrace, 24-hour doorman, light filled, etc." I forgot we didn't have much money. The next day he went to look at something in Brooklyn, "Castle in the Sky,'' said the ad.

VCongressional Republicans are hoping yet again to split the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which covers nine Western states and has issued some rulings to the dismay of conservatives, saying a breakup is the best way to reduce the caseload of the circuit's federal judges. Next week, Senator John Ensign, Republican of Nevada, plans to introduce a bill to split the circuit into three parts. Representative Mike Simpson, Republican of Idaho, has already introduced legislation that would create two new appellate courts for the area.

VSeveral hundred police officers conducted an extensive series of predawn raids against a gang on Tuesday, resulting in the arrest of 23 people on charges of conspiracy, drug trafficking and murder. The raids, the culmination of an 18-month investigation into the activities of the Vineland Boys, a gang founded in the late 1980's in the San Fernando Valley, involved about 1,300 federal and local police officers and nine helicopters, making it one of the largest law enforcement efforts in the Los Angeles area in years, officials said. The raids, which were based on 43 search warrants, began at 3:30 a.m.

VOn the first episode of his new reality series, the beleaguered R&B singer Bobby Brown pokes fun at his extensive rap sheet and his bad boy reputation. ''Maybe you don't recognize me because I'm not in an orange jumpsuit,'' he tells two middle-aged men dining in a fashionable restaurant. Mr. Brown then turns around and places his hands behind his back as if he's being handcuffed. (It is a stance that he has become quite accustomed to over the years.) ''Recognize me now, don't you?'' He may joke about his criminal record, the tabloid headlines and reports of a rocky marriage, but Mr. Brown, 35, is quite serious about using his new series, ''Being Bobby Brown,'' to set the record straight about his life. ''On a daily basis, I'm trying to prove my point, that I'm more good than I am bad.''

A1 Law Strands Romanian Orphans A new child welfare law passed in Romania essentially forbids international adoptions, leaving hundreds of families in Western Europe and the United States without children they had counted as theirs. A1 U.S. to Send North Korea Food The Bush administration said it would send 50,000 metric tons of food to North Korea this year, even as other American officials press ahead with plans to deprive the country of hard currency if there is no progress in talks over ending the country's nuclear weapons program. A3 Calls for Iraq Pullout Plan The top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee called for a shift in American policy toward Iraq, saying the administration must hold out the prospect of a major troop withdrawal unless Iraqis agree on a constitution by February.

A10 Air Force Pilot Dies in U2 Crash The pilot of an American spy plane was killed when his aircraft crashed in the United Arab Emirates after completing a surveillance mission over Afghanistan, military officials said. It was the first crash of a U-2 flying reconnaissance missions in support of the military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. A6 NATIONAL A12-17 Senators Investigate Dealings by Lobbyist The Senate Indian Affairs Committee heard testimony contending that Jack Abramoff, a Republican lobbyist, and his associates defrauded several Indian tribes by charging them millions of dollars in fees and expenses to promote their gambling interests. A1 U.S. Raids Marijuana Clubs Federal agents executed search warrants at three medical marijuana dispensaries as part of an investigation into marijuana trafficking in San Francisco, setting off fears among medical marijuana advocates that a crackdown had begun on the sickest users of the drug. A12 Study Cites Ohio Voting Flaws A five-month study for the Democratic National Committee found that more than one in four Ohio voters experienced problems at the polls in last year's election, but the study did not find evidence of widespread fraud that might have contributed to President Bush's narrow victory there. A12 Prostitutes' Patrons, Online The Chicago police department began posting on its Web site the photographs, names and partial addresses of people arrested for soliciting prostitutes, in hopes of embarrassing offenders and deterring people from making such solicitations. A16 SCIENCE/HEALTH Chemotherapy for Lung Cancer For the first time in decades, doctors have begun making major changes in the treatment of lung cancer, based on research proving that chemotherapy can significantly lengthen life in many patients in whom it was once thought to be useless. A1 NEW YORK/REGION B1-9 Council Drops Veto Fight Over Mayor's Trash Plan The New York City Council abandoned its veto fight with Mayor Bloomberg over his trash disposal plan, handing Mr. Bloomberg a major political victory in what had become a test of wills with Council Speaker Gifford Miller, who is also running for mayor. B1 Contraceptive Bill Passed The New York Senate passed a bill that would allow pharmacists and nurses to dispense the so-called morning-after pill to women who do not have prescriptions. The Assembly has already passed the bill, which now goes to Governor Pataki. B1 Drunken Airborne Caper An intoxicated 20-year-old man stole an airplane from an airport in Danbury, Conn., and took two friends on a joy ride that somehow ended with a safe landing at the Westchester County Airport, the authorities said.

VFederal agents executed search warrants at three medical marijuana dispensaries on Wednesday as part of a broad investigation into marijuana trafficking in San Francisco, setting off fears among medical marijuana advocates that a federal crackdown on the drug's use by sick people was beginning. About 20 residences, businesses and growing sites were also searched, leading to multiple arrests, a law enforcement official said. Agents outside a club in the Ingleside neighborhood spent much of the afternoon dragging scores of leafy marijuana plants into an alley and stuffing them into plastic bags.

VINTERNATIONAL A3-11 Iraqis Tally Corruption Since American Invasion An office originally set up by the American occupation to investigate governmental corruption in Iraq, now run by the Iraqis, has accumulated estimates of how corruption has dogged the government since the invasion in 2003, when billions of dollars for reconstruction and training began pouring into the country. A1 Gen. John P. Abizaid, the top American commander in the Middle East, said the insurgency in Iraq had not diminished, seeming to contradict statements by Vice President Dick Cheney in recent days that the insurgents were in their ''last throes.'' A1 Four car bomb blasts struck a central Baghdad commercial district, killing at least 17 people. The bombings raised the combined toll in the capital to at least 43 dead and 100 wounded in a string of similar attacks. A9 U.S. Sees Consensus on Syria Bush administration officials said an international consensus had emerged that Syria had been stoking the violence in Lebanon and Iraq, and they said they were now certain that Syrian agents had been operating in Lebanon. A5 Anti-U.S. Moods Abating The anti-Americanism that surged through much of the world over the war in Iraq shows signs of abating, although distinctly negative views persist in the Muslim world, an international opinion poll indicates. A10 Customs Standards Agreed On The World Customs Organization voted to endorse comprehensive standards intended to fight terrorism, which United States officials predict will revolutionize the way goods are tracked. A4 NATIONAL A14-20 Justices Back GovernmentIn Eminent Domain Case In one of its most closely watched property rights cases in years, the Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that fostering economic development is an appropriate use of the government's power of eminent domain. A1 Doctors' Role at Guantánamo Military doctors at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, have aided interrogators in conducting and refining coercive interrogations of detainees, including providing advice on how to increase stress levels and exploit fears, according to detailed accounts given by former interrogators. A1 Ex-Klansman Gets 60 Years Edgar Ray Killen, an 80-year-old former Klansman in a wheelchair, was sentenced to 60 years in prison for his role in the deaths of three civil rights workers in 1964. A14 Medical Marijuana as Cover Federal authorities said they had cracked their biggest case involving the use of medical marijuana dispensaries in California as a cover for drug dealing and money laundering. A14 Rove Under Fire for Comments Leading Democrats reacted furiously to remarks by Karl Rove that their party had responded to the Sept. 11 attacks by wanting to ''prepare indictments and offer therapy.'' A16 EDUCATION Language Barriers in Academia With a steep rise in the number of foreign graduate students, undergraduates at often find themselves in classes and laboratories run by graduate teaching assistants whose mastery of English is less than complete. A1 NEW YORK/REGION B1-8 Modest Change ExpectedIn Rules for Skyscrapers A federal agency released a final report on the collapse of the World Trade Center, recommending fundamental changes in the next generation of skyscrapers, but many structural engineers expect that any change will be modest and slow. B1 Move to Hold Early Primary New Jersey legislators voted overwhelmingly this week to move the state's presidential primary to February from June. The bill awaits the signature of Acting Gov. Richard B. Codey, who is one of the bill's sponsors.

VOpens today in Manhattan Directed by Cevin Soling Not rated, 74 minutes Destined for instant pairing with the 1936 exploitation classic ''Reefer Madness'' on the midnight-movie circuit, ''The War on the War on Drugs'' gleefully takes aim at United States drug policy with ingenuity and heavily disguised logic. Already the proud winner of a best experimental feature award at the New York Independent Film and Video Festival, the movie is 74 minutes of hilarious pro-drug vignettes, loosely strung together like a themed episode of ''Saturday Night Live.''

VThose who believe, as we do, that marijuana should be legally available for medical treatments have to be concerned about reports of abuses in California's pioneering medical marijuana program. If the abuses cannot be curbed, a political backlash could undermine the ability of thousands of patients to get marijuana to treat the nausea of chemotherapy, the loss of appetite that accompanies AIDS and other medical problems. The future of medical marijuana in California and 10 other states that allow its use is already precarious given a recent Supreme Court decision that the federal government may prohibit and prosecute the possession and use of marijuana for medical purposes. Nobody yet knows what impact that decision will have on the states but raids by federal agents on medical marijuana dispensaries in San Francisco this week could be harbingers of a broader crackdown. Public officials would be wise to clean up their programs lest flagrant abuses by a few bad actors bring about destruction of a program that benefits many.

VAndre Willis started selling cocaine and heroin when he was 14, and by 25 had been sent to prison four times. Each time he got out he vowed to look for an honest job. But employers did not want to hire an ex-convict, so he would give up after two months and go back to selling drugs and smoking marijuana. The fourth time the state offered a different kind of sentence: a year at a new state prison dedicated solely to drug treatment, where Mr. Willis was given job training and addiction counseling that has continued into his parole.

VHearing that the Rhode Island legislature approved the use of medical marijuana Tuesday night, Rhonda O'Donnell sat in her Warwick, R.I., living room and giddily thought about legally sautéing the drug in some butter and putting it into a cake mix. Ms. O'Donnell, 42, who has multiple sclerosis, hopes ingesting marijuana will ease the stiffness and numbness in her legs that leave her unable to work or move without pain.

VFor years, Washington hungered for a baseball team. Now it has one, and a winning team at that. But in a city where politics course through the veins of the inhabitants, where Republicans run the show and the man in the White House is himself a former baseball team owner, it was probably too much to expect the Washington Nationals to usher in a bipartisan era of peace, love and understanding.

VThe Senate braced on Friday for a Supreme Court confirmation fight that threatens to strain a tenuous new agreement on handling court nominations and plunge the chamber back into partisan strife. Even though President Bush has not announced a nominee, some leading Democrats made clear that they would oppose any candidate whom they judged too conservative, particularly because the candidate would replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a moderate.

VThe two members of the Islamic terrorist cell pulled up to the curb at the airport and quickly exited their Cadillac Escalade. As one hustled a passenger -- a biochemist from a local university -- out of the backseat and into the terminal, his destination Vancouver but his intentions unknown, the other nervously picked up a pay phone. He was alerting his supervisor at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

VJustice Sandra Day O'Connor's unexpected retirement announcement last week shifted public attention toward her legacy and the Supreme Court's future and away from the term that just concluded. But the term -- apparently not the Rehnquist Court's last, after all -- contained its share of notable developments that, taken together, cast a shadow of ambiguity over Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's legacy. The court's federalism revolution stalled, while the revival of property rights, which appeared to be taking off not long ago, crashed and burned on a riverbank in New London, Conn.

VDRIVING to a memorial service for his mother one day in late 2000, Alex Briscoe took a wrong turn into the flat, forgotten streets of west Oakland, finally idling his motor outside McClymonds High School. He saw a teenager smoking marijuana on the front lawn until a security guard gave chase. He noticed the razor wire around the perimeter. Even as an educator who had worked in South Philadelphia, no place for the naïve, Mr. Briscoe asked himself, ''How can this be?'' McClymonds ranked by any measure among the worst handful of high schools in the entire state. Barely a fifth of entering ninth graders lasted until graduation. Virtually none of those survivors could qualify for admission to the University of California system. Just a few months earlier, an 18-year-old senior, Khadafy Washington, had been shot and left to die on the school playground.

VLocal officials from across the country yesterday declared methamphetamine the nation's leading law enforcement scourge -- a more insidious drug problem than cocaine -- and blamed it for crowding jails and fueling increases in theft and violence, as well as for a host of social welfare problems. Officials from the National Association of Counties, releasing results from a survey of 500 local officials nationwide, argued that Washington's focus on terrorism and domestic security had diverted money and attention from the methamphetamine problem in the states.

VThe dean of students at an intermediate school on Staten Island can be fired for a criminal conviction for drug possession, an appellate court ruled unanimously yesterday. The ruling, by the Appellate Division, First Department, overturned a lower court ruling and invalidated an arbitrator's determination that the New York City Department of Education could not fire the dean, Michael Campbell, of I.S. 72 in the Heartland Village section. Mr. Campbell, who was arrested in 2002 after detectives found cocaine and marijuana in his car, was a teacher at the school for about a decade and its dean for four years, and had no history of wrongdoing. An arbitrator ordered that he be reinstated after completing a drug treatment program. But the Appellate Division said in its ruling that it found the decision ''to defy common sense,'' as it would place Mr. Campbell in charge of the program that discourages drug use among students.

VThe placard that identified Pete Jensen's office as part of the Senate Judiciary Committee was removed not long ago, to discourage unwanted visitors from riffling through his voluminous files. Security is being tightened; soon, Mr. Jensen, a top aide to Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania and the committee chairman, will need an electronic passkey to get in. ''Not on our watch,'' Mr. Jensen declared, vowing to prevent leaks of the sort that doomed the Supreme Court confirmation of Douglas H. Ginsburg, who withdrew from consideration in 1987 when it was revealed that he had smoked marijuana.

VConcerned that state workers might be charged with abetting federal crimes, California health officials announced Friday that they would no longer issue identification cards to medical marijuana patients. Sandra Shewry, the state health director, said the decision came in response to a United States Supreme Court ruling last month. In a 6-to-3 vote, the court upheld the power of the federal authorities to prosecute the possession and use of marijuana for medical purposes, even in states like California that allow such use under state law.

VWHEN Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase died in 1873, President Ulysses S. Grant did not want to waste time naming a successor. He offered the job to Roscoe Conkling, the mercurial senator from New York, in the carriage ride to Chief Justice Chase's funeral. Mr. Conkling turned him down, which may have been a good thing, as he proved to have something less than a judicial temperament. He resigned his Senate seat in 1881 in pique over federal appointments in his state, then ran unsuccessfully to fill the vacancy caused by his own resignation.

VLast summer at one hospital in Dallas, four people died from rabies, an unheard-of level of incidence of this rare disease. As it turned out, each patient was infected by an organ or tissue -- a kidney, a liver, an artery -- that he or she received in a transplant several weeks earlier. Their shared donor, William Beed Jr., a young brain-dead man, had rabies, caught apparently through a bite from a rabid bat, something the surgeons never suspected. They all thought he had suffered a fatal crack-cocaine overdose, which can produce symptoms similar to those of rabies. ''We had an explanation for his condition,'' says Dr. Goran Klintmalm, a surgeon who oversees transplantation at Baylor University Medical Center, where the transplants occurred. ''He'd recently smoked crack cocaine. He'd hemorrhaged around the brain. He'd died. That was all we needed to know.'' Since the rabies deaths, recriminations have flown, procedural reviews have begun and sorrow and regret have dogged the families of the organ recipients. But the outbreak also exposed a controversy that until then was roiling only the rarefied world of transplant specialists. The issue, although freighted with monetary and bio-ethical complexities, can be boiled down to one deceptively simple question. Should transplant surgeons be using organs from nearly anyone?

VFor a while, Ricky Williams was a character straight out of a Herman Melville short story, a modern-day Bartleby. He withdrew from the workaday world last July, telling his employer, the Miami Dolphins, that he preferred not to carry the football anymore. Unlike Bartleby, a copyist who starved himself to death rather than submit to a life of soul-crushing compromises and repetitious tasks, Williams reconsidered. His agent has said Williams will return to the Dolphins this month and resume running off tackle.

VSon Volt is a band that inspires either passionate devotion, or very little response at all. One of the two groups that resulted from the breakup of the alternative-country exemplar Uncle Tupelo (the other was Wilco), Son Volt made its last album in 1998. Since then its leader, Jay Farrar, has been working on his own, making an American mythology with comforting bits and pieces, including Neil Young's electric guitar sound and Woody Guthrie's social consciousness. His work is always honest, and rarely exciting. That continues to apply to Son Volt's comeback album, ''Okemah and the Melody of Riot'' (Transmit Sound/Legacy), with different musicians, but the same sound. As ever, the album is deadpan Americana, a vote for the old and rock-ribbed and forgiving, both in American music and social values. From the first track, ''Bandages & Scars,'' a beautiful, warm, tube-amplifier sound asserts itself; you know you're in an idealized corner of pop music.

VThe apartment buildings lining Decatur Avenue north of 195th Street have official-looking signs bolted to the brick, declaring that hallways are off limits to drug dealers, muggers and anybody else with mayhem in mind. The signs warn any and all here in the Bedford Park neighborhood of the Bronx that the police will arrest trespassers. This has clearly driven out the bad guys. Now they can be found lounging on the sidewalks instead. Their presence is as obscenely defiant as the graffiti slogan slathered on nearby concrete barricades and walls. The three-word slogan -- which gained infamy as the title of a rap by the group N.W.A. -- starts with a four-letter word and ends with ''the police.''

VRobert E. Chambers Jr., the convicted killer whose crime seemed to expose a dark side in the lives of young people on the Upper East Side in the 1980's, is heading back to jail -- for three months. At a pretrial hearing in Manhattan Criminal Court yesterday, Mr. Chambers agreed to plead guilty to heroin possession and driving with a suspended license, avoiding what could have been a one-year sentence if he had been convicted by a jury. The judge, Gerald Harris, also ordered Mr. Chambers to pay a $250 fine on the license charge and told him to return to court on Aug. 29 for formal sentencing.

VFOR centuries the Netherlands has been considered the most tolerant and liberal nation in the world. This attitude is a byproduct of a disciplined civic society, confident enough to provide space for those with different ideas. It produced the country in which Descartes found refuge, a center of freedom of thought and of a free press in Europe. That Netherlands no longer exists.

VMayoral candidates spent last week scrambling to get enough signatures to get on the ballot on the Democratic or Republican lines. But one party registered in New York was ignored by the candidates: the Marijuana Reform Party. There are 25 voters registered with the party in New York City, according to the city's Board of Elections. That compares with 2.6 million registered Democrats and 477,000 registered Republicans.

VThe Loss of Leon Meed By Josh Emmons 338 pages. Scribner. $24. ''The Loss of Leon Meed,'' Josh Emmons's first book, is a eureka novel in the literal sense: Eureka, Calif., is home to the 10 main characters who ramble and ricochet through its story. ''It was a city whose 40,000 inhabitants faced the Pacific Ocean on one side and all of America on the other,'' Mr. Emmons writes with crisp, gratifying authority. ''It sat between the deeps.'' This book also aspires to a larger eureka sensation, the kind that accompanies a discovery. That ambition is reflected by its structure. Mr. Emmons adopts the kind of format that has characters bumping into one another unawares until they form a web of interconnection. Whether on the page or the screen, this is a much-used, convenient way of juxtaposing minor events and making them appear to have larger meaning.

VState officials have revived a medical marijuana identification card program, saying that it did not violate federal law. The state health director, Sandra Shewry, closed the program 10 days ago, citing concerns over a recent United States Supreme Court ruling that allows the federal prosecution of people who smoke marijuana under a doctor's recommendation. The ruling did not strike down laws in California and nine other states that permit medical cannabis use, but said federal drug laws took precedence.

VThe current zeal for sending doctors to jail for writing painkiller prescriptions may seem baffling, especially to the patients who relied on the doctors for pain relief. But if you consider it from the perspective of the agents raiding the doctors' offices, you can see a certain logic. During the war on drugs in the 1980's and 1990's, federal and local agents risked their lives going after drug gangs on the streets. As their budgets for drug enforcement soared, they arrested hundreds of thousands of people annually and filled a quarter of American prison cells with drug offenders.

VThe scene was festive across the street from the Miami Dolphins' training facility Sunday morning. People parked their cars along the side of the road, pulled beach chairs out of their trunks, passed around doughnuts, bagels and binoculars, and watched for the scheduled relaunching of an N.F.L. career that was scrubbed deep into the countdown for the 2004 season. At 8:48 a.m., a year and a day after running back Ricky Williams telephoned the Dolphins to tell them he was retiring, he reported for training camp with dreadlocks sprouting like seedlings from his head and a black tuft of whiskers growing from his chin.

VRicky Williams's first formal news conference since he retired from the Miami Dolphins a year ago without forewarning or a farewell address began with Williams stepping stiffly to the microphone and murmuring, ''How's everybody doing today?'' Williams is not a glib public speaker, the football field being the only place in which he is really comfortable expressing himself. His unease during the next 17 minutes was evident in his staccato sentences, his words accelerating in fits and starts as if there were a bottleneck in his breathing passageway.

VSummer has long been a time of renewed efforts to lose excess pounds that are hard to hide under skimpy hot-weather clothing. And to be sure, some people (rarely those significantly overweight) manage to shed 5 or even 10 pounds before the Fourth of July. But having just driven from New York to Minnesota and back, at every rest stop I saw evidence of what health experts are calling a national crisis -- an epidemic of obesity, especially life-limiting, health-robbing morbid obesity.

V10 P.M. (HBO) BILL MAHER: I'M SWISS -- Mr. Maher (right), whose series ''Politically Incorrect'' bit the dust after he described the Sept. 11 terrorists as not cowardly, returns in this performance special, filmed in Portland, Ore. His topics include the presidential election, marijuana, homeland security and gay marriage. 7 P.M. (WE) LOVE STORY -- (1970). Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw star in this unashamed tear-jerker, adapted from Erich Segal's novel. Mr. O'Neal is Oliver Barrett IV, a rich Harvard student with a cold, unfeeling father (Ray Milland). Ms. MacGraw is Jennifer Cavalleri, a poor Radcliffe music major from Rhode Island. Ollie and Jenny love each other, but the world is against them, and eventually so is medical science. 9 P.M. (Food) JULIA CHILD: A TRIBUTE -- Food Network chefs pay homage to Child, who brought French cooking to Americans. She died last August. 9 P.M. (Starz) THE FORGOTTEN -- (2004). Telly (Julianne Moore, left) is a Brooklyn woman whose son disappears. As do all the photographs of him. Then a psychiatrist (Gary Sinise) tells her that the boy never existed, that she had invented him to deal with the anguish of a recent miscarriage. Telly doesn't believe the doctor for a minute and goes in search of the truth. 9 P.M. (Sci Fi) BLOODSUCKERS -- (2005). This film, about an elite team of intergalactic vampire hunters, stars, among others, Joe Lando (as Nicholas Churchill, the commander), A.J. Cook, Michael Ironside and Natassia Malthe. 10 P.M. (Cinemax) NAPOLEON DYNAMITE -- (2004). Jon Heder stars as the title character, a nerdy Idaho high school boy whose uneventful life shifts slightly when his grandmother is hospitalized and his strange Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) moves in. Then Napoleon coordinates a student election campaign for his new friend Pedro (Efren Ramirez ), who is running against Summer Wheatly (Haylie Duff, sister of Hilary). 11 P.M. (History) MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF JIMMY HOFFA -- On July 30, 1975, James R. Hoffa, the former Teamster president, left to meet two men at a Michigan restaurant and was never seen again. MIDNIGHT (55) THE X-FILES -- In this 1997 episode, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny, right), brooding F.B.I. agent and true believer, and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), his skeptical partner, investigate the death of a woman found trapped inside a bowling-alley pin setter. Aliens do not appear to be involved. ANITA GATES

VON Monday, a sightseeing bus in Times Square was boarded by armed police officers. They herded 60 tourists into the street with their hands in the air, and forced five of them, innocent men it turned out, to kneel in the gutter, with their hands handcuffed behind them. Each of the men was wearing a backpack, which, along with dark complexions (the five were South Asian) is what drew the attention of a bus company employee, who considered the men suspicious and informed the bus driver, who in turn alerted the police.

VIT doesn't take long for ''Weeds,'' a gleefully transgressive new Showtime series, to light a fire underneath the exhausted form of the half-hour television comedy. In the opening scene of the pilot episode, we are introduced to Nancy Botwin, a recently widowed soccer mom played by Mary-Louise Parker, at a P.T.A. meeting. While she is arguing to have soda machines banned from her children's school, her peer group of despairing homemakers is quietly gossiping about the authenticity of her new designer handbag and wondering how the suddenly single mother of two has been able to maintain her standard of living. Cut to Scene 2, where we find a more relaxed Nancy casually trading quips, barbs and homespun wisdom with the people who make her feel most at home: a family of drug dealers who supply her with the marijuana she sells to the residents of her sleepy California suburb.

VA Lower East Side man was charged yesterday with criminal possession of marijuana and attempting to bribe a police officer, law enforcement officials said. Police officers, responding to reports of a dispute, said they were overwhelmed by the smell of marijuana in an apartment on Essex Street. They said the occupant, Sami Chartouni, 31, had dozens of plastic bags filled with the drug. After one of the officers arrested Mr. Chartouni, he offered the officer a bag filled with thousands of dollars, the police said. The police said they seized about 150 pounds of marijuana and $375,000 in cash. Jennifer Medina (NYT)

VShowtime's "Weeds," about a dope-dealing suburban matron, is a darkly comic drama loosely wrapped in playful satire.

VBritish Report Hints About a New Attack Plan The British police began carrying out their largest security campaign here since World War II as intelligence officials said they had picked up information, in the form of a cellphone text message, that another team might be planning a synchronized bombing in London or elsewhere in Britain. PAGE A6 Jewish Militant Kills 4 on Bus An Israeli Army deserter killed four Israeli Arabs on a bus in northern Israel and wounded at least a dozen others before a crowd beat him to death, witnesses said. PAGE A4 Harvard Asset Job Unfilled Eight months after the investment manager of Harvard University's $23 billion in assets resigned, the school has yet to name a successor. BUSINESS DAY, PAGE C1 An Intimate View of Degas The Arthur M. Sackler Museum in Cambridge, Mass., offers a glimpse of Edgar Degas's artistic career in ''Degas at Harvard,'' an exhibition made up of more than 70 works from the university's collection. PAGE E25 Digging for a Jewish Capital The seal above is of an official mentioned in the Book of Jeremiah. It was dug up by an Israeli archaeologist in Jerusalem in what she believes may be the palace of the biblical King David. That might prove that Jerusalem was the capital of an ancient Jewish kingdom. PAGE A4 Orioles Dismiss Mazzilli The turbulent week of the Baltimore Orioles continued with the dismissal of Manager Lee Mazzilli. The move came shortly after Rafael Palmeiro's suspension for steroid use. SPORTSFRIDAY, PAGE D2 Dealing in the Suburbs The heroine of the darkly comic new Showtime series ''Weeds'' is a suddenly widowed soccer mom who sells marijuana to make ends meet.

VFew things draw double takes in Washington Square Park, and yesterday that Greenwich Village venue bustled with its usual weekend array of street musicians and performers, speed-chess players and marijuana sellers. Suddenly, out of the typical cast of characters -- the elderly Rastafarian with long gray dreadlocks and clad in a loincloth, the guy crafting boxes out of burnt matchsticks, the flutist playing hip-hop -- there came a truly odd sight. A man dressed all in black swooped down on the scene, riding a unicycle and blowing a shrill whistle.

VTHE Rolling Stones may be the world's greatest rock 'n' roll band, but for years it was the most notorious as well. One of the Stones' most infamous public dust-ups took place on May 28, 1969, when the police raided the London apartment of Mick Jagger. The bobbies said they found heroin, LSD and marijuana; Mr. Jagger insisted that the drugs had been planted there. Ultimately, he was fined 200 pounds (about $500) for possession of cannabis.

V''Red Hash,'' a ruminative album by the Connecticut folkie Gary Higgins, received no critical notice and sold fewer than 2,000 copies when it was released in 1973. It was reissued by Drag City on July 29, and now Mr. Higgins and ''Red Hash'' -- which, the Times critic Kelefa Sanneh wrote, ''unfolds as a series of cyclical strummed melodies and lyrics that float by like ominous daydreams'' -- are enjoying their moment as lost treasures. Here's where they've been for the last 32 years, and how they re-emerged. MAY 1965: Gary Higgins, a native of Sharon, Conn., starts playing in a rock band called Random Concept with five friends. The band plays the Greenwich Village circuit, where it backs up Gary U.S. Bonds and the singer Dee Dee Sharp. Eventually it becomes the house band at the Hookah club in Torrington, Conn. MARCH 1971: Random Concept breaks up; Mr. Higgins forms an acoustic band called Wooden Wheel. OCTOBER 1972: Mr. Higgins is arrested in a drug sting and convicted of selling marijuana. In early 1973, before his incarceration, he records ''Red Hash'' at the Odyssey studio in Harwinton, Conn. MARCH 1973: Mr. Higgins enters the maximum-security state prison in Somers, Conn., where he will serve 13 months. ''Red Hash'' will be released on the Nufusmoon label while he is behind bars. He has no say in naming the album. APRIL 1974: Mr. Higgins is released and takes a number of odd jobs, including dishwasher and waiter. 1990's: ''Red Hash'' is rediscovered by collectors of vinyl albums. Most know nothing about Mr. Higgins, yet sealed copies of the album sell for $200 and more on eBay. JULY 2003: The vinyl enthusiast Zach Cowie is given a CD burn of ''Red Hash'' by Ben Chasny of the band Comets on Fire. Entranced, Mr. Cowie is determined to track down Mr. Higgins and release the album on the Chicago independent label Drag City, where he works in sales. Over the next year, he contacts every Gary Higgins he can locate in the United States. NOVEMBER 2004: Mr. Cowie hits pay dirt when he gets an e-mail message from Mr. Higgins, now a registered nurse in Connecticut, who writes that he is ''flattered and a bit amazed that there are some folks out there that still find pleasure from the music.'' JULY 2005: Mr. Higgins plays his first solo show ever in New York, at Tonic on the Lower East Side; his backup band includes some members of Random Concept. The first pressing of 5,000 CD's of ''Red Hash'' sells out. MARC WEINGARTEN

VTo the Editor: I read Dave Itzkoff's article about the new Showtime series ''Weeds'' [''Mommy, What's That in Your Purse?,'' last Sunday] with some interest, but the characterization of the main character's decision to sell marijuana as ''unforgivable'' was puzzling. Given that she is described as having sufficient scruples not to sell to kids, there is no indication of anything unforgivable in her actions, unless one believes that marijuana itself is horribly dangerous. In fact, research has consistently found marijuana to be far less toxic and addictive than alcohol or tobacco. Bruce Mirken San Francisco The writer is a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, a nonprofit group opposed to the prohibition of marijuana.

''Using drugs,'' he wrote, ''is wrong not simply because drugs create medical problems; it is wrong because drugs destroy one's moral sense. People addicted to drugs neglect their duties.''

VFor the third time in two months, Essex County authorities have charged a guard with smuggling drugs into the county jail and selling them to inmates. Authorities said on Friday that the latest culprit was Jay Griggs, 35, a correction officer who worked at the jail for 10 years. According to the police, Officer Griggs was arrested on Wednesday night lugging trash bags full of marijuana, heroin, cocaine, cigarettes, rolling papers and other contraband into the jail. The scheme, prosecutors said, involved a jailed drug dealer, Jibreel Williams, who placed orders over the telephone to his girlfriend, Janie K. Singletary, in suburban Orange. Officer Griggs then picked up the drugs and contraband at Ms. Singletary's home and smuggled them into the jail, prosecutors said. Officer Griggs has been charged with official misconduct and drug possession and conspiracy. Mr. Williams, 25, and Ms. Singletary, 31, face similar charges. All three remain in jail.

VFRESHLY released on bail, Marc Emery faced the camera of his Pot-TV.net Web site the other day to make an urgent appeal for money to finance his legal struggle to avert extradition to the United States for trafficking marijuana seeds south of the border. ''Let me be the light that shines on the American gulag,'' he said, stern-eyed, pointing into the camera. Without notes, Mr. Emery sermonized for a half-hour about everything from the marvelous medicinal and spiritual qualities of pot to the greatness of Thomas Jefferson, ''who gave America on hemp paper the Declaration of Independence.''

Hall, above left, with Mr. Krause), and their California funeral home have been through a lot in five seasons. In anticipation of the series finale on Sunday night, this is a one-hour, two-part special on their lives, loves, crises and panic attacks. 7 P.M. (History) MODERN MARVELS: THE CHRYSLER BUILDING -- It is arguably the most gorgeous example of Art Deco architecture in New York. Completed in 1930 at the corner of Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street, it was briefly the tallest building (1,046 feet) in the world. That seven-story sunburst spire was built in secret, then set in place at the last minute. 9 P.M. (2) TWO AND A HALF MEN -- ''The Price of Healthy Gums Is Eternal Vigilance.'' Charlie (Charlie Sheen) has always been the bad boy and Alan (Jon Cryer, far right, with Mr. Sheen) the goody twoshoes. In this episode, first shown in October, the truth comes out about which brother was actually guilty of shoplifting a toy. 9 P.M. (Lifetime) CAPTIVE HEARTS -- It's that old story: husband is kidnapped. Wife and detective team up and discover international conspiracy. Wife and detective fall in love. Greg Evigan, Robin Givens and Tracey Gold star in this television movie. 10 P.M. (Showtime) WEEDS -- Selling marijuana to maintain your pleasant suburban lifestyle has its downside, as Nancy Botwin (Mary-Louise Parker) learns in tonight's episode of this wicked new series. Like being forced to pay your bills with cash -- or not being able to pay them at all. So her accountant (Kevin Nealon) suggests she establish another business as a front. Meanwhile, her friend Celia (Elizabeth Perkins in a role she can sink her teeth into) ships her older daughter off to Mexico and shaves her unfaithful husband's head. 10 P.M. (Travel) ANTHONY BOURDAIN: NO RESERVATIONS -- ''The Island of Mr. Sang.'' Having tackled Paris and Iceland, Mr.Bourdain (left),possibly the only chef on television whose series isn't a cooking show, visits Vietnam. ANITA GATES

VIn the immortal words of Yoko Ono, ''Aieeeee!'' A fierce primal scream -- of the kind Ms. Ono is famous for as a performance and recording artist -- is surely the healthiest response to the agony of ''Lennon,'' the jerry-built musical shrine that opened last night at the Broadhurst Theater. The title character of ''Lennon'' is, of course, John Lennon, the onetime Beatle and (more to the purposes of this show) Ms. Ono's artistic collaborator and husband, who died nearly 25 years ago. Biographies of Lennon indicate that he was a man of corrosive intelligence, overflowing creativity, Lucullan indulgences and enough inner demons to fill a county in hell.

VSometimes the football felt right leaving Chad Pennington's fingertips, but fell incomplete because he made the wrong read. Other times his decision-making was solid, but his throws were shaky. Pennington's stoicism during the first few days of the Jets' training camp was a smokescreen, hiding a discomfiting feeling that was only natural considering he was having to learn a new offense at the same time he was relearning how to throw after having major shoulder surgery.

VAce of Clubs, four more performances through Aug. 22 4 Great Jones Street, at Lafayette Street In a one-man show, ''Confessions of a Dope Dealer,'' Sheldon Norberg is surprisingly unapologetic about his life choices. He says a drug dealer is ''a pioneer to whom we entrust our consciousness,'' and notes, '''Dealer' is 'leader' misspelled.'' He also argues for the legalization of illicit drugs, maintaining they have value as both medicine and guides to spiritual clarity. (Indeed, with his shaved head, piercing eyes, all-black outfit and dynamic delivery, Mr. Norberg could be mistaken for a rogue preacher.) The blunder that he and his customers made, Mr. Norberg says, was in using drugs ''as toys rather than tools.'' Mr. Norberg, who seems to be in his mid-40's, didn't always have such attitudes; he grew up a straight arrow who lectured fellow students against addiction. His resolve began softening, however, when his parents tried to quit drinking coffee and became jittery. It slowly dawned on him that most people have addictions -- if only to caffeine, cigarettes or alcohol.

VThe men's basketball program at the University of Connecticut has enjoyed tremendous success under Coach Jim Calhoun, including two national championships during the past six seasons. But it suffered a blow yesterday when Calhoun indefinitely suspended two members of the team who were arrested in the theft of four laptop computers. Marcus Williams, a junior and the starting point guard, surrendered to the university police Tuesday night and was charged with four counts of third-degree larceny, a felony. He had just returned from Argentina, where he played for the United States in the men's under-21 world championships.

VINTERNATIONAL A3-10 Israeli Army and Protesters Clash at Gaza Synagogues The Israeli Army and the police moved to break the back of resistance to the pullout from Gaza, seizing control of two synagogues where hundreds of the most fervent and aggressive protesters had barricaded themselves. A1 U.S. Aid Cuts Causing Strain Aid cuts for countries that refused to sign agreements to shield Americans from the International Criminal Court are generating resentment, particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean, home to 12 nations that have been penalized, officials in seven countries said. A1 Roadside Bomb Kills 4 in Iraq A roadside bomb killed four American soldiers as the political stalemate over the country's draft constitution stretched into another day. In Russia, President Vladimir V. Putin called for a timetable for withdrawing foreign troops from Iraq, Russian news agencies reported.

VJohn G. Roberts Jr. arrived at Harvard in the fall of 1973, a nascent conservative from a Catholic boarding school in the Republican Midwest, transplanted to Cambridge, Mass., at a time when campus conservatism seemed to be in hibernation. Prep school Marxists blustered about armed struggle, and students picketed liquor stores for carrying a boycotted wine. Conservatives were casually dismissed as a joke. Judge Roberts, President Bush's Supreme Court nominee, spent the next six years at Harvard and Harvard Law after Watergate and before the election of President Ronald Reagan --when it was almost possible to graduate from Harvard without ever encountering a card-carrying conservative in a seminar or a dining hall or having seriously to confront a conservative position.

VFOR much of the summer, it's been too hot to do any real work; bakingly hot, you might say. So here are 20 half-baked ideas for columns I might have actually written in a cooler season: 1. DUMB BACK-TO-SCHOOL STUFF -- I'm not sure what this has to do with New Jersey, but some marketing outfit sent me a boxful of new products for the fashionable student, most ridiculous among them PaperMate antibacterial pens. Yes, antibacterial pens. But note: ''Antibacterial technology is designed to protect the pen's surface and does not extend protection to the skin,'' the package explains. Apparently the idea is to prevent the pen itself from getting a cold. Also in the box: an ''Auto Advance Mechanical Pencil,'' which ''ensures you'll never have to click to advance the lead in a mechanical pencil again.'' Just when you thought Americans couldn't be lazier, we can't even exert the energy to click a mechanical pencil. 2. WORST T-SHIRT OF THE SUMMER -- Seen in Seaside Heights, it said, ''What happens in Seaside Heights stays in Seaside Heights.'' What grates about this is not just that we're so lame we have to steal another city's catchphrase. It's that nothing ever happens in Seaside Heights. Which brings us to another column: 3. LET'S FACE IT: THE JERSEY SHORE IS BORING -- Ratty amusement parks with ancient rides; the same five unappetizing foods being sold at stand after stand; unattractive bods on the beach. Ugh. Shut it down. 4. NEW JERSEY: THE OBTUSE STATE -- Not long ago two state assemblymen, Jon M. Bramnick and Gordon M. Johnson, introduced a resolution encouraging us ''to treat one another civilly.'' But in my experience, our biggest problem isn't the occasional raising of the middle finger; it's that average New Jerseyans seem incapable of recognizing their own thoughtless behavior or that it might affect people around them. Case in point: A newspaper columnist is riding the train into the city. The people in the seat in front of him have a boy, maybe 3 years old, who apparently has never been on a train and who has one of those earsplitting kiddie voices. Inexplicably, they let him hang over the seat back and look out the columnist's window for the entire hourlong trip, during which he continually shouts ''MOMMY! LOOK AT THAT!'' directly into the columnist's face, at a distance of two feet. 5. NEW JERSEYANS: NOT AS BRIGHT AS WASHINGTONIANS -- In Washington, where I once lived, everyone who rides the subway seems to have mastered a simple escalator rule: stand to the right, so that people in a hurry -- neurosurgeons with patients waiting on the operating table, for instance -- can scurry up the left side. But on the New Jersey Transit platforms at Penn Station in New York, the first two arriving New Jerseyans to reach a given escalator will stop dead side by side. They'll thereby clog the way for hundreds of people behind them, causing the deaths of countless neurosurgery patients. (These same two people, at the top of the escalator, will take one step and again stop dead to discuss where to eat lunch, while behind them the escalator continues to disgorge fellow passengers who, having no room to exit, are ground up like hamburger in the stairway's powerful mechanism.) 6. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE YAMS? -- My favorite headline of the year so far was on a news brief moved in February by The Associated Press out of Port Elizabeth: ''Customs Agents Find Over 6 Tons of Marijuana in Yam Shipment.'' The pot was seized; the fate of the yams remains unclear. 7. THE E-ZPASS CONSPIRACY -- The printing on Turnpike tickets has become so teeny that it can be read only with an electron microscope, a plot to force the last holdouts to cave in and get E-ZPass. And E-ZPass, of course, was created by a secret government agency whose mandate is to track our movements and, eventually, control us through signals sent by satellite to our E-ZPass tags, cellphones and iPods. 8 THROUGH 16. NINE THINGS I'M TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT -- Bears. Deer. McMansions. Whether Camden can revitalize itself. Whether Newark can revitalize itself. Whether Atlantic City can revitalize itself. Whether Asbury Park can revitalize itself. Whether Christie Whitman can revitalize herself. Springsteen. 17. ANAGRAMS FROM STATE LEGISLATORS' NAMES -- Linda Greenstein: straining needle. Ronald Rice: idle rancor. 18 THROUGH 20. THINGS WE DON'T NEED ANYMORE OF -- Anagrams from state legislators' names. Books by former governors. Half-baked newspaper columns.

V9 P.M. (National Geographic) INSIDE 9/11: ZERO HOUR -- The two-hour conclusion of this documentary focuses on the experiences of survivors of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the last minutes of those who died there. Part 2 of 2. 8 P.M. (TV Guide) READY, SET, CHANGE -- This new series combines two of America's current fascinations: show business and home improvement. The designers redo rooms to look like the sets of the homeowners' favorite shows. 8 P.M. (Ovation) THE GREAT GATSBY: MIDNIGHT IN MANHATTAN -- F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel about a mysterious, doomed Long Island millionaire in love with a married woman was published in 1925. Fitzgerald's friends and family, authors and others analyze its appeal 80 years later. 9 P.M. (Lifetime) FIGHTING THE ODDS: THE MARILYN GAMBRELL STORY -- Jami Gertz (left), a star of the sitcom ''Still Standing,'' turns serious in this television film about a Texas parole officer who quits her job to start a support group for teenagers whose parents are in prison. The idea is to help them avoid ending up the same way. The crime-ridden high school where Ms. Gambrell chooses to work does not make this easy. 9 P.M. (History) DECODING THE PAST: COUNTDOWN TO ARMAGEDDON -- Asteroids hurtle toward Earth, supervolcanoes simmer, killer viruses seem to appear out of nowhere and global warming just gets worse. This special asks if there have always been disasters-in-waiting like these or if they are signs of the end of the world predicted in the Bible. Part 1 of 2. 10 P.M. (Showtime) WEEDS -- Nancy Botwin (Mary-Louise Parker), suburban widow, mom and pot dealer, has to do something to compete with legal medical marijuana. As one client (Kevin Nealon) says, ''I love California.'' So she puts her product into tasty baked goods. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Perkins's vicious character, Celia, humiliates her slightly overweight little daughter and is repaid appropriately. 11:05 P.M. (Spike) THE ULTIMATE FIGHTER 2 -- Yes, martial arts experts (below) have their own reality competition show. In Las Vegas. ANITA GATES

VTo the Editor: Though we are fortunate to have such an astute observer of national drug policy as Sally Satel, ''A Whiff of 'Reefer Madness' in U.S. Drug Policy'' (Commentary, Aug. 16) is unfair at best in presenting the true picture about why national leaders have particularly focused on marijuana use among youth. Our decision to drive attention toward marijuana was borne primarily in new, unsettling scientific data pointing to marijuana use alone as a major risk factor in mental illness, roadside accidents, cognitive impairment and poor performance in school.

VFlipper Contributed Reporting for This Article An interview is a complicated thing. There are times when interviews take off and times when they go nowhere at all. And there are times, gentle reader, when they take sudden sharp turns and everything gets very weird, as if the train of conversation has left the tracks and rocketed off to Pluto. There is often even a specific moment in these in which one can identify the departure from reality. Usually a celebrity journalist can predict with whom one of these moments will happen. For example, SHIRLEY MacLAINE. And, as we discovered on Saturday, the funk bassist and fashion alien BOOTSY COLLINS.

V10 P.M. (ABC Family) KICKED OUT -- Some people would love to suffer from empty-nest syndrome. In this new reality series, eight sets of parents whose adult sons and daughters have come back home to live -- or have never left -- throw the kids out. Now they'll be forced to prove they can make it in the real world. And possibly do their own laundry. Justin, above left, and Jason, shown with their parents, are among the newly independent. 8 P.M. (Discovery Health) BODY CHALLENGE: ULTIMATE SLIMDOWN -- There are many ways to try to lose weight. Courtney Caplan, a 27-year-old hotel catering and special events coordinator from Austin, Tex., decided to go to the Duke Diet and Fitness Center in North Carolina. Her weight-loss goal was 75 pounds. 9 P.M. (4) LAW & ORDER ''Cut.''' A novelist's death seems to have been caused by careless liposuction. This episode was first shown in October 2004. Earlier that year Olivia Goldsmith, author of ''The First Wives Club,'' died after minor cosmetic surgery at a New York hospital. 10 P.M. (Bravo) KATHY GRIFFIN: MY LIFE ON THE D-LIST -- In this quasi-reality series, Ms. Griffin (left) is hired to work with Star Jones, doing redcarpet interviews at the Grammy Awards. But in last week's episode, the two had a bit of a confrontation on the daytime talk show ''The View.'' 10 P.M. (Comedy Central) SOUTH PARK -- ''Goobacks.'' The town of South Park, Colo., has seen many kinds of invaders, from space aliens to a Barbra Streisand monster to unwanted hippies. In this 2004 episode, immigrants from the year 3045 arrive through a time portal, looking for jobs. They will work for practically nothing and are soon so numerous that schools are required to teach both English and Futurespeak. Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny, who had hoped to make extra money shoveling snow, are unhappy. 10 P.M. (FX) OVER THERE ''Embedded.'' There's no shortage of horror in this series about an American fighting unit in Iraq. Tonight, Smoke ( played by Kirk Jones, below right), the inner-city Californian who loves marijuana and hates white people, is implicated in the killing of a civilian. Bo (Josh Henderson), the babyfaced Texan football hero too poor to go to college, is now learning to walk with a prosthetic leg. ANITA GATES

VThe congregation's leaders were like disappointed parents. Earlier this month, their widely popular rabbi had been charged with possessing marijuana and driving while his ability was impaired by drugs, both misdemeanors. Now, the board of trustees at Congregation Sons of Israel had to decide on the proper punishment. In the end, after a meeting that began on Tuesday night and lasted until 2 a.m. on Wednesday, they decided that the rabbi, Steven C. Kane, 50, should receive a 30-day paid suspension.

VWhen the Supreme Court ruled in June that states could not legalize marijuana for medical uses, Justice Stephen Breyer voted with the majority. But during oral arguments, he suggested an alternative way for patients to get it: let the federal Food and Drug Administration decide if marijuana should be a prescription drug. ''Medicine by regulation is better than medicine by referendum,'' he said. In theory, that sounds reasonable. But what if the officials doing the regulation are afflicted with a bad case of Reefer Madness?

VI. The Future Is Not the Present Three years ago, in a small conference room at the offices of the law firm Hogan & Hartson in Washington, I had the chance to talk with John G. Roberts Jr. At the time, Roberts was a lawyer in private practice, unsure whether Senate Democrats would hold a hearing on his nomination to be a federal appellate judge. (After being nominated three times, in 1992, 2001 and 2003, he would finally be given a hearing and confirmed in May 2003 after Republicans took control of the Senate.) In a conversation over cookies and coffee, Roberts spoke candidly about a wide range of topics, and I was impressed by his modesty, intelligence and sense of humor.

V8 P.M. (5) PRISON BREAK -- What do you do when someone you love is about to be executed? In this one-hour drama, filmed at Joliet Prison in Illinois, Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller, left), a structural engineer, deliberately gets himself arrested and sent to prison so he can help his brother (Dominic Purcell) escape from death row. Michael has an advantage: he helped design the place. 8 P.M. (11) 7TH HEAVEN -- ''Honor Thy Mother.'' Bo Derek guest-stars in this April episode of the most aggressively wholesome long-running show in prime time. Twenty-six years after ''10,'' Ms. Derek has moved on to mother-in-law roles. 8 AND 8:30 P.M. (Trio) JOHNNY STACCATO -- Yes, the great John Cassavetes once starred in a television series, a 1959-60 private-eye drama, which Trio is showing Monday through Friday. Cassavetes, who died in 1989, also directed tonight's two episodes, one about a jockey and a dance-hall girl, the other about a gang of counterfeiters. 9 P.M. (Lifetime) STRANGER IN MY BED -- Jamie Luner (left), the star of the last season of ''Profiler'' and a regular on ''Melrose Place,'' plays an abused wife in thistelevision movie. Toescape her husband(Chris Kramer), she fakes her own deathand starts a new life with a new identity, but her husband tracks her down. Which is exactly the same plot as Julia Roberts's 1991 movie ''Sleeping With the Enemy.'' 10 P.M. (Showtime) WEEDS -- ''Fashion of the Christ.'' Nancy (Mary-Louise Parker) is not happy when her brother-in-law Andy (Justin Kirk of ''Angels in America'') comes to visit and to sell ''Chris Died for Your Sins'' Tshirts(without a T) to impressionable children. He also finds out about Nancy's thriving marijuana dealership. 10 P.M. (National Geographic) NAKED SCIENCE: BERMUDA TRIANGLE -- Of all the strange stories of lost ships and planes that have been told about this area (stretching from Miami to Bermuda to Puerto Rico),Flight 19 is the best known. It was a training exercise in which 14 military aviators in five bombers disappeared. This episode retracestheir route in a vintage Avenger bomber. MIDNIGHT (CMT) 20 GREATEST CITY SONGS -- ''Okie From Muskogee'' (written and performedby Merle Haggard,right) is a lovely tribute to Oklahoma values,but includingit calls for arather loose definitionof ''city.''

VIn a turnaround, one of the state's biggest law enforcement agencies says it is taking a hands-off approach to the possession and use of marijuana for medical purposes. The new policy, by the California Highway Patrol, states that an ''individual is to be released and the marijuana is not to be seized'' if the person qualifies under state law to possess marijuana for medicinal purposes. It also says that officers ''shall not conduct traffic enforcement stops for the primary purpose of drug interdiction'' involving the authorized use of medical marijuana.

VTwo and a half years after his release from prison, Robert E. Chambers Jr., the man the tabloid headlines called the preppy killer, went back to jail yesterday after pleading guilty to possessing traces of heroin. In this latest run-in with the law, Mr. Chambers was sentenced to 100 days at Rikers Island by Judge Gerald Harris in Criminal Court in Manhattan. It was hard to believe that the frazzled and disheveled defendant standing before the judge was the same smooth and handsome young man whose crime had once obsessed New York City.

VINTERNATIONAL A3-9 Petty Corruption Stunts Developing Economies Petty corruption is an everyday trial for millions of poor people across Asia, Africa and Latin America. Increasingly, it is being recognized as an obstacle to economic development and robbing the impoverished of already measly incomes. A1 U.S. AIDS Policy Challenged A top United Nations official and a number of advocacy groups for AIDS patients charged that Bush administration policy had led to a shortage of condoms in Uganda, increasing the risk of infection for many people. A4 Sunnis Protest Constitution More leaders of Iraq's Sunni Arab minority spoke out against the nation's draft constitution, as thousands of people took to the streets to denounce the document in Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown. A9 The Air Force's top general said American warplanes would have to support Iraq's fledgling security forces well after American ground troops eventually withdrew from the country. A9 North Korea Delays Talks North Korea said it would not return to negotiations in Beijing over its nuclear program this week as scheduled, but proposed to resume the talks the week of Sept. 12. A3 U.S. Weapons Sales Up The value of military weapons sales worldwide jumped in 2004 to the highest level since 2000, driven by arms deals with developing nations, especially India, Saudi Arabia and China, according to a new Congressional study. A8 NATIONAL A10-16 Hurricane Katrina Rips Through the Gulf Coast Hurricane Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast with devastating force at daybreak, sparing New Orleans the catastrophic hit that had been feared but tearing down neighborhoods in Louisiana and Mississippi, tossing boats onto highways, and leaving hundreds of people clinging to buildings that had lost their roofs. A1 State National Guard units joined federal, state and private organizations in a broad effort to provide relief. A13 Insurance companies said that damages could top $9 billion, making Hurricane Katrina one of the costliest storms on record. A12 Residents and officials of Gulfport, Miss., one of the cities hit hardest by the storm, could hardly find the words to describe the devastation -- streets clogged with fallen trees and power lines, fancy casinos with giant holes punched in the outer walls, collapsed buildings and flooded beachfront homes. A1 Husband, Father, Defendant Matthew Koso, 22, the father of a 4-day-old baby, is scheduled to be arraigned on Tuesday on sexual assault charges for having sex with the baby's 14- year-old mother, whom he later married. A10 Religion Guidelines for Air Force The Air Force issued new religion guidelines to its commanders that caution against promoting any particular faith in official communications or functions. A10 Marijuana Policy in California The California Highway Patrol says it is taking a hands-off approach to the possession and use of marijuana for medical purposes. A15 NEW YORK/REGION B1-8 Ex-Connecticut GovernorFaces New Felony Charges John G. Rowland, who is serving a year in federal prison in Pennsylvania on a corruption charge, is expected to return to Connecticut to face new felony charges that he violated the state's laws against lobbying after leaving office, his lawyer said. B1 Connecticut Sues Over Jets Connecticut sued to stop the Pentagon's planned transfer and retirement of fighter jets from the Air National Guard base at Bradley International Airport, saying the move would exceed the federal government's authority.

VMore than 20 years ago, as a young White House lawyer, John G. Roberts Jr. warned against expanding federal law enforcement powers to agencies like the Commerce, Agriculture and Interior Departments, declaring that ''activities such as arrest and search are the most intrusive a government performs,'' and seconding a recommendation that such functions be limited to the Justice and Treasury Departments. Mr. Roberts's advice was in a May 16, 1984, memorandum to the White House counsel, Fred F. Fielding, then his boss, at a time when agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Bureau of Land Management were pressing for -- and sometimes getting -- police powers to handle problems like toxic waste investigations and armed marijuana growers in the West.

VTo the Editor: Glaucoma and the side effects of AIDS treatments (and chemotherapy) are not the only conditions for which marijuana use can be a critical palliative (''Marijuana Pipe Dreams,'' by John Tierney, column, Aug. 27).

VWhen the police visited an assisted-living facility in Pittsburgh, they found employees cooking more than just the evening meal. The authorities said on Tuesday that they had seized a laboratory used to make methamphetamine. Two arrests there were among more than 400 that were part of the first nationally coordinated operation focused on producers and sellers of methamphetamine, a highly addictive drug.

VDance-Floor Focus Group Test audiences are a longtime staple of movie marketing. Now, a pop music star has borrowed the technique. Madonna, right, has chosen songs for her next album, ''Confessions on a Dancefloor,'' after trying them out on unsuspecting British night clubbers, The Sunday Telegraph reported. Stuart Price, 28, a D.J. and producer who is collaborating on the CD, said in an interview for the singer's Web site that the tunes, minus her vocals, were played in clubs in Liverpool, Ibiza and elsewhere in June, with the reaction of the crowds filmed for the singer. ''You can work on a song for 12 hours,'' Mr. Price said, ''but I guarantee you'll know within just 10 seconds of putting it on at a club whether it works or not. So these songs were tested on unwitting subjects throughout Europe.'' A spokesman for Madonna, 47, declined to comment. The album, from Warner Brothers Records, is scheduled for a November release. Ozzfest Dust-Up It was a raucous performance on a raucous tour, but the commotion wasn't the band's doing. When Iron Maiden took the stage for its last appearance on the Ozzfest tour, this month in Devore, Calif., the group's sound was cut off several times. Last week, the tour's organizer, Sharon Osbourne, left, admitted she was responsible, Billboard.com reported. In a statement that took the form of an open letter to Iron Maiden's manager, Rod Smallwood, Ms. Osbourne said her action came in response to derogatory remarks she said the group's singer, Bruce Dickinson, had made onstage about the tour and Black Sabbath, the group led by her husband, Ozzy Osbourne. ''Was Dickinson so naïve to think that I was going to let him get away with'' comments about her family, she asked in the statement. She signed the letter as the ''real Iron Maiden.'' Mr. Smallwood said this week that he had ''never seen anything anywhere near as disgusting and unprofessional as what went on that night.'' Garfunkel and the Law The singer Art Garfunkel, below, is facing another charge of marijuana possession, again in upstate New York. The Daily Freeman of Kingston, N.Y., reported Tuesday that Mr. Garfunkel, 63, of Manhattan had been pulled over in Woodstock for failing to stop his car at a stop sign, and a trooper who smelled an odor had found a joint in his car ashtray. He was issued a ticket and is due back in Woodstock Town Court on Sept. 22. In January 2004, the singer was charged with marijuana possession after the state police stopped his limousine for speeding in the Ulster County town of Hurley and found a small amount of pot in his jacket. He pleaded guilty to that charge and paid $200 in fines. Forget the Show Another performance would not make up for a canceled Las Vegas concert that is at the heart of a dispute between Rod Stewart, below, and Harrah's Entertainment, the company's head testified on Monday, The Associated Press reported. At a federal court in Las Vegas where the breach-of-contract suit was being heard, Gary Loveman, the chairman and chief executive of Harrah's, said the show, scheduled for New Year's Eve 2000 in the company's Rio hotel, was meant to celebrate the millennium and thus was expected to be a big draw. Mr. Loveman also said Mr. Stewart had refused at the last minute to perform a New Year's Eve 1999 show unless he was also hired for the 2000 date and paid $2 million in advance. Mr. Stewart's lawyer, Louis Miller, has said that the show was canceled because of the singer's operation for thyroid cancer in May 2000 and that Mr. Stewart offered to play a makeup date. The company is seeking the return of the $2 million. Composers With Cash Mozart famously died penniless. But it's less well known which composers were the wealthiest. A classical music station in Britain set out to estimate the earnings, adjusted for inflation, accrued in a composer's lifetime and came up with a list led by George Gershwin, above, The Guardian reported on Monday. Gershwin earned millions of dollars from ''Rhapsody in Blue,'' ''Summertime'' and many other compositions, ranking him ahead of Johann Strauss, who charged more than $50,000 an appearance. Verdi was third on the list; his take included a commissioning fee of nearly $300,000 for ''Aida.'' Rounding out the Top 10 in order were Rossini (who received more than $5,000 a lesson), Handel, Haydn, Rachmaninoff, Puccini, Paganini and Tchaikovsky. Theater Notes With ''The Phantom of the Opera'' on track to surpass ''Cats'' in January as the longest-running show in Broadway history, the Phantom who has logged the most stage time in the role on the Great White Way is returning to the show. Howard McGillin, who has played the masked one more than 1,200 times, will take over on Oct. 3 for Hugh Panaro, who has played the part more than 1,000 times. On Jan. 9 the show will break the longevity record with performance No. 7,486. ''The Producers'' will welcome back an original cast member. On Tuesday, Gary Beach, who left in 2003, returns to play Roger De Bris, the role for which he won a Tony Award. It's possible he could be on stage and screen in the same role at the same time: he also plays Roger De Bris in ''The Producers'' movie, scheduled for release in December. Though little is known about a Twyla Tharp show based on Bob Dylan songs, one mystery has been cleared up. The title will be ''The Times They Are A-Changin','' Broadway.com reported yesterday. It is set to play the Old Globe Theater in San Diego early next year. A Loan Criticized In 2001, the British prime minister, Tony Blair, lent a bronze bust of Winston Churchill to President Bush, a fan of the wartime leader, but the little-known gesture of friendship is drawing a great deal of attention now. The Observer in London reported on Sunday that the work, created in 1946 by Jacob Epstein after six sittings with his subject, is owned by the public British Government Art Collection, which is allowed to lend its holdings for display only on property owned by Britain. The collection has come under scrutiny for its handling of art worth millions of pounds, and the bust's move is being examined in a radio documentary to be broadcast on the BBC tomorrow. ''This is usually a well-run collection, but they should stick to their rules,'' Gill Hedley of the Contemporary Art Society told The Observer.

VWhen the performance artists Delia Bajo and Brainard Carey fell in love in 1999, they say, they gave up everything to explore their newfound happiness. ''It was a little irresponsible,'' Ms. Bajo said recently, sipping tea in a pastry shop near P.S. 122 on the Lower East Side. ''We stayed in bed all day, rejoicing in the sensuality of life. It was euphoric.'' Ms. Bajo, 32, who had studied ballet, and Mr. Carey, 38, a former gallery owner, soon began sharing their feelings with others in interactive, multidisciplinary projects, presented under the name Praxis, at places like the Whitney Biennial and the Dublin Fringe Festival. In neo-''happenings,'' they offered audience members and passersby hugs, foot washings, prayers and, on one occasion, marijuana; that event also featured a John-and-Yoko-like couple frolicking naked on a bed. Mr. Carey's mother died recently, and in their new piece, ''Forget Me Not, a New Economy Mass'' (at P.S. 122 from Wednesday through Sept. 13), Ms. Bajo and Mr. Carey hope to help others find ways to cope with loss. ''We use ambient music, dance, text, art and prayer to create a comforting atmosphere,'' Mr. Carey said. ''We have 10 performers but we also want audience members to participate. We watch the gestures and movements of nonprofessionals and incorporate them into our work.''

VA pregnant teenager went to the grand and imposing county courthouse here early in the summer, saying she wanted an abortion. The circuit court judge refused to hear the case, and he announced that he would recuse himself from any others like it. ''Taking the life of an innocent human being is contrary to the moral order,'' the judge, John R. McCarroll of Shelby County Circuit Court, wrote in June. ''I could not in good conscience make a finding that would allow the minor to proceed with the abortion.''

VNUDIE COHN might have trouble customizing cars today. His six-shooter door handles would raise eyebrows at Homeland Security. (Don't even mention the rifles affixed to the trunk and fenders.) Steer horns on the hood would hardly meet pedestrian-safety standards. Hand-tooled leather saddles, placed between the front seats for young cowpokes, wouldn't pass muster as child-safe seating. Rare silver dollars, adorning nearly every surface of the interior, would surely prove too tempting for passers-by.

V8 P.M. (Hallmark) SUPERNOVA -- Zebras are stampeding, dolphins are beaching themselves and fireballs are vaporizing the Western United States. The world is going toend in seven days, just after the sun explodes, and the only person behaving sensibly is a Nobel Prize-winning scientist (Peter Fonda) who heads to a tropical island. However, an astrophysicist (Luke Perry), a government agent (Tia Carrere) and a reporter (Emma Samms, above, with Mr. Fonda) may be able to make a difference. 6 P.M. (TCM) SUNSET BOULEVARD -- (1950). William Holden's character, a struggling young screenwriter, narrates the story, but Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), the faded silent-film actress, is the center of the universe in this scorching classic drama. One of them ends up face down in a swimming pool. The other flips out and begins raving about Cecil B. DeMille. 9 P.M. (TNT) THE CLOSER -- Season finale. Brenda Leigh Johnson (Kyra Sedgwick), an abrasive Southern policewoman, has settled into her job handling high-profile murdercases in Los Angeles. Tonight, while she's investigating the death of a filmmaker, someone files a grievance against her. Brenda's personality has always been a problem. 9 P.M. (History) ROME: ENGINEERINGAN EMPIRE -- While HBO turnsancient Romeinto fiction in its new series, this documentary sticks to the facts (equallysordid or close to it) about Julius Caesar, therise of the Roman Empire, especially its architecture, and the culture's eventual demise. 9 P.M. (Sundance) I AM TRYING TO BREAK YOUR HEART -- (2002). In this documentary, the band Wilco makes its fourth album, ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,'' andlearns that its recording label, under newmanagement, has decided not to release it. 10:30 P.M. (Showtime) WEEDS -- ''Lude Awakening.'' Nothing is simple for an honest, hard-working suburban marijuana dealer (Mary-Louise Parker) these days. Her visiting brother-in-law, Andy (Justin Kirk), decides to take up drug sales himself. Celia (Elizabeth Perkins), who announced last week that she had cancer, seeks out a faith healer (Lorna Raver, below left, with Ms. Perkins). ANITA GATES

The wait has seemingly been interminable for Vick, a quarterback who had been touted as the second coming of the program's savior, Michael Vick, his older brother. Three years after Marcus Vick arrived on campus, fans are still wondering if he can be another Michael.

VGeorge Clinton ''How Late Do U Have 2BB4UR Absent?'' (The C Kunspryruhzy) When George Clinton asks ''Brother, can you paradigm?'' on his new album, ''How Late Do U Have 2BB4UR Absent?'' (The C Kunspyruhzy), it's not as if he hasn't dispensed a few paradigms himself. While leading Funkadelic and Parliament -- the same band under various contracts -- in the 1970's, Mr. Clinton expanded funk from a rhythm to a philosophy. His funk found liberation in carnal pleasures and rebellion in humor, and it embraced rhythm-and-blues, psychedelic jams, jazz and metal. The slow, swampy grooves of Parliament-Funkadelic (shortened to P-Funk) have been recycled constantly by hip-hop. In June, Mr. Clinton regained the rights to widely sampled Funkadelic albums, including ''One Nation Under a Groove'' and ''Hardcore Jollies,'' of which he had been deprived for 15 years.

VWilliam H. Rehnquist, who died Saturday at the age of 80, almost a year after learning he had thyroid cancer, helped lead a conservative revolution on the Supreme Court during 19 years as chief justice of the United States. Chief Justice's Rehnquist's death came six weeks after he refuted rumors that he would soon retire by announcing that he intended to serve as long as his health permitted. At the time of the announcement, on July 14, photographers had been camped out for weeks outside his house in Arlington, Va.

V9 P.M. (Lifetime) AMBULANCE GIRL -- (2005) Kathy Bates directedand stars inthis fact-based television movie about Jane Stern, a troubled food writer with a bad marriage. She takes up a new avocation,as a volunteer emergency medical technician, and finds a new sense of purpose. Above: Ms. Bates as Ms. Stern, with Robin Thomas as her husband, Michael. 8 P.M. (ABC Family) WILDFIRE -- Season finale. Kris (Genevieve Cortese), a former juvenile delinquent, is in luck. She's going to be able to ride Wildfire, her cherished horse, in the big race after all. That's because the competing ranch has stolen away Tina Sharp (Amy Jo Johnson), the obnoxious star jockey the Raintree ranch had hired. Meanwhile, a gambling addiction is getting the best of gorgeous young Matt (Micah Alberti). 9 P.M. (USA) IN AND OUT -- (1997). Kevin Kline stars as a small-town schoolteacher who watches the Academy Awards on television one night, only to hear a former student refer to him as gay. This comes as a surprise to his fiancee (Joan Cusack, above, with Mr. Kline) and to Mr. Kline's character himself. It's a comedy. 9 P.M. (ABC Family) BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE -- The New York adventures of Lynn Kerr (Daphne Zuniga) and her two lovely teenage daughters (Sarah Foret and Torrey DeVitto) continue with a visit to the Hamptons. The Kerrs are just small-town girls from New Mexico, getting used to the East Coast fast lane. Their host is the rich, powerful and very married Julian Fiske (James McCaffrey), who happens to be an ex of Lynn's. 10 P.M. (Showtime) WEEDS -- ''Dead in the Nethers.'' The people around Nancy Botwin (Mary-Louise Parker), suburban pot dealer, are busy in tonight's episode. Her friend Celia (Elizabeth Perkins, below left, with Ms. Parker) has a hot night out. Her brother-inlaw, Andy (Justin Kirk), who was arrested for drug possession, meets an attractive woman at Marijuana Anonymous. And her housekeeper, Lupita (Renee Victor), finally becomes suspicious about just how Nancy is making her money these days. ANITA GATES

VSunday after church, Tracy Jackson braided extensions into her Auntie's hair on the back porch as her boyfriend, Jerel Brown, relaxed on a rocker, trading insults with a nurse named Mary as though he had known her his whole 24 years instead of five crazy days. The men plopped piles of catfish into a Dutch oven of boiling oil over a gas fire in the yard, while the children -- the ones from New Orleans who are afraid of spiders and snakes, and the ones who grew up in this hamlet driving four-wheelers and shooting their first deer at age 6 -- played on a rusty swing set at the woods' edge.

VChristopher X. Brodeur, a political gadfly who has been arrested three times on charges that he harassed members of the mayor's press office staff, won a surprising 4 percent of the vote in yesterday's party primary for mayoral nominee. Maybe it was his pledge to eliminate all subway fares. Or perhaps it was his desultory campaign promises, as outlined in a column in The New York Press several months ago, to cap apartment rent increases at 10 percent, legalize marijuana, eliminate the posts of borough president, and install free public toilets throughout the city. Whatever the reason, more than 17,000 of the roughly 455,000 Democrats who cast primary ballots yesterday chose Mr. Brodeur for mayor over a raft of higher-profile candidates with full campaign staffs.

VIf any city in the country was ready for the disaster of Hurricane Katrina, it was Houston. When the catastrophic storm set off the largest mass migration in modern American history, this subtropical-oiltown-turned-energy-capital of two million people quickly set an extra 200,000 places for dinner.

VIt was a long, late night of drinking and coincidental meetings, and three worlds collided, prosecutors said: a preppy college kid from Fairfield University crossed paths with a Long Island girl he knew and wound up at the house of a young man from Brooklyn whom prosecutors called an aspiring thug. There was a party, late into the night, with beer and marijuana and eventually a gun. And in the morning, Mark Fisher, the college student, was found wrapped in a blanket, shot five times in the torso and dumped near the curb on Argyle Road in Prospect Park South.

VIN New York, 2001 was a year to remember for the young and politically savvy. That year, newly imposed term limits flushed out most of the City Council, and recent changes in the city's campaign-finance regulations meant that candidates could receive windfalls in public financing. In the years since, young people have become more visible than ever in city politics, whether forced by term limits to seek higher office (Gifford Miller, 35, is a prime example), or encouraged by the vacuum of power to seek election. The tide is so powerful that the staff employees of many former council members have run for council seats themselves, among them Jessica Lappin, 30, and Gur Tsabar, 32, both former aides to Mr. Miller. (In Tuesday's primary, she won, he lost.)

VTHE legal case of Rabbi Steven Kane was closed on Sept. 14. The misdemeanor charges against him for possession of marijuana were dropped. For driving with ability impaired by drugs, he received a citation and paid a $400 fine. The incident is a mark on his driving record -- nothing more than a traffic violation. But the real conflict was never in the legal system; it was in Rabbi Kane's community at Congregation Sons of Israel here. In the weeks since he was stopped by the state police after driving erratically and was found with just under an ounce of marijuana, the rift among the faithful whom he has led for 13 years has only widened.

VAND here most people assumed that the race for governor involved two self-sufficient oligarchs -- Senator Jon S. Corzine, the Democrat, and Douglas R. Forrester, his stern Republican rival. Yet like ghosts hovering on the fringes of this year's race, there are a handful of independent candidates clamoring to be heard, often with great persistence and ingenuity but little success. There is Matt Thieke, a computer programmer who has tried to get attention for his low-profile campaign by ambushing the major candidates at public events. Edward Forchion -- who, as a proponent of legalizing marijuana, is better known to a small segment of the electorate as ''NJWeedman'' -- slipped into the news briefly, but only by being arrested at protests in Trenton and Seaside Heights.

VAshley Smith, who was held hostage in her apartment in March by the man now charged with murder in the Atlanta courthouse shootings, was hailed as a hero after she disclosed how she had persuaded her captor to surrender, partly by reading to him from the spiritual best seller ''The Purpose-Driven Life.'' But in a memoir released yesterday, Ms. Smith also recounts that she gave the kidnapper some of her supply of crystal methamphetamine during her captivity and that she did not tell the police for some time afterward.

VA Westchester County nanny was arrested in Dobbs Ferry this week when she was caught transporting 10 pounds of marijuana in her employers' sport utility vehicle while her 1-year-old charge sat in the back seat, the authorities said yesterday. The nanny, Sanjay Rodriques, 24, was acting as a drug courier for a housekeeper who works nearby and had planned to give the drugs to a dealer for sale on the street, said Thomas Belfiore, the county's public safety commissioner. Officers who received a tip about the package began trailing Ms. Rodriques on Monday morning; they caught up to her hours later as she was meeting with the housekeeper, Paula Bennet, 33, who was also arrested, Mr. Belfiore said.

V'Well' Goes to Broadway Written by and starring the author, ''Well,'' Lisa Kron's highly praised memoir about her mother, herself and the ultimate unknowability of people, is coming to Broadway. The play, called ''wonderful'' by Ben Brantley of The New York Times when it opened last year at the Public Theater, is to begin previews at the Longacre Theater on March 10 and regular performances on March 30. Ms. Kron, above, as the daughter, and Jayne Houdyshell, as the mother, will reprise their roles; and Leigh Silverman will once again direct. D'Angelo: I'm All Right D'Angelo wants everybody to know that he is O.K. and eager to record. The Grammy-winning rhythm-and-blues crooner told The Associated Press that he had ''banged up my ribs, but other than that I'm fine,'' although he had been hospitalized for a few days in an car crash. The Virginia State Police reported that he was listed in critical condition after he was ejected from a Hummer on Sept. 19 when it crossed a roadway and hit a fence. D'Angelo, whose real name is Michael Eugene Archer, said he was a passenger and the police said he was not wearing a seat belt. After hits in the 1990's and a Grammy in 2001, he has had problems with the law. This year he has been convicted on cocaine, marijuana and alcohol charges, and his driver's license was suspended. Dead Beats Notorious B.I.G. may be dead, but that doesn't mean he can't go right on rapping, even with fellow dead people like Bob Marley. B.I.G., right, also known as Biggie Smalls, who died in a shooting in March 1997, is heard with Marley, the reggae star who died in 1981, on ''Hold Ya Hand,'' released on Monday by AOL Music, Reuters reported. ''Hold Ya Hand'' will also be heard on ''The Notorious B.I.G. Duets: The Final Chapter,'' to be released on Nov. 29 by Bad Boy. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band of 1975 vintage will be seen and heard once more when Columbia Records releases the three-disc ''Born to Run 30th Anniversary Edition'' on Nov. 15. The set includes a DVD of their memorable 1975 concert at the Hammersmith Odeon in London, as well as the DVD ''Wings for Wheels: The Making of Born to Run,'' and a CD of a remastered ''Born to Run,'' as well as a 48-page booklet of previously unreleased photographs.

VLawyers for inmates in Louisiana say that prison guards have abused some of the nearly 8,000 prisoners who were evacuated from flooded jails in the New Orleans area after Hurricane Katrina. The allegations are contained in affidavits filed by lawyers who have interviewed thousands of inmates in recent weeks. The complaints include accusations that some guards left prisoners locked in their cells while floodwaters rose to their necks, and that others engaged in regular beatings and other abuse.

V10 P.M. (Bravo) GREAT THINGS ABOUT BEING FAT -- Well, it gives you fabulous cleavage (if that's what you're going for). And you can be everybody's bestfriend. Or a man in a giant dog costume, like John Candy (above) in Spaceballs.'' So says this satire about stereotypes, the first in a five-part series. The week's other episodes address advantages in being gay, 30, blond and a resident of a red state. 7:30 P.M. (USA) MONDAY NIGHT RAW -- This three-hour ''homecoming'' episode of World Wrestling Entertainment's big ratings hit welcomes the series back to its original channel (after some time at Spike). 9 P.M. (Speed) WORLD'S GREATEST AUTO SHOWS -- At the 61st International Motor Show in Frankfurt, new cars include the Fiat Grande Punto, Peugeot 407 coupe, Porsche Cayman S and Volvo C70 convertible. 9 P.M. (Lifetime) HAUNTING SARAH -- Kim Raver (above), of ''24,'' ''Third Watch'' and ''Sesame Street'' (when she was 6), plays Erica and Heather, identical twins, in this supernatural drama. The twins have 6-year-old children who are inseparable. When little David dies, little Sarah still seems to be hearing from him. 10 P.M. (Showtime) WEEDS -- Nancy Botwin (Mary-Louise Parker), suburban marijuana dealer, has a run-in with campus security at the local community college and ends up short of $14,000 in product. Her younger son (Alexander Gould) demands antidepressants. Her best friend (Elizabeth Perkins), going through chemotherapy for breast cancer, recaptures the P.T.A. presidency by coup. 10 P.M. (4) MEDIUM -- Allison DuBois (Patricia Arquette, left, nowan Emmy winnerfor this role) has yet another disturbingdream: about being a woman in a mental institution in 1959. In Allison'sworld, it's not so strange to learn that the womanreally existed. Itis a bit odd, though, that the woman claimed to be Allison DuBois, from the future (2005). ANITA GATES

VThere are 2,174 annotations at the end of Suzanne Finstad's ''Warren Beatty: A Private Man,'' one of several new memoirs and biographies about glamorous guys. This book also devotes four pages to the actor's family tree. Its research spans centuries and goes back to Swords, Ireland, for the ''great procreators'' on his father's side to Little Bras d'Or, Nova Scotia, for his mother's. Mr. Beatty winds up only a few degrees of separation away from George Washington, if you count the role of one ancestor in the French and Indian War. Call this comprehensive or call it crazy. Either way, it shows how difficult it is to find news about someone so often photographed and interviewed that his legend precedes him. Even this person's autobiography can be upstaged by writers who are shameless in what they insinuate or make up. So telling the truth has some novelty in this genre. But it needn't be as strenuous as Ms. Finstad makes it seem.

VAbout 9,700 American prisoners are serving life sentences for crimes they committed before they could vote, serve on a jury or gamble in a casino -- in short, before they turned 18. More than a fifth have no chance for parole. Juvenile criminals are serving life terms in at least 48 states, according to a survey by The New York Times, and their numbers have increased sharply over the past decade.

VArticle in No Way Out series focuses on 9,700 American prisoners serving life sentences for crimes they committed before they were 18, 2,200 of whom, according to Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, with no possibility of parole; 350 of that 2,200 were sentenced of crime committed when they were 15 or younger; rights groups say there are only three other countries that have juveniles serving such sentences: Israel, which has seven, South Africa, which has four, and Tanzania, which has one; prosecutors and activists expect such sentences to become next legal battleground, citing fact that Supreme Court took into account international attitudes when it banned juvenile death penalty in March; opinion of Justice Anthony M Kennedy in that decision, which said that teenagers are immature, irresponsible and more susceptible to negative influences, appears on mark in cases of Rebecca Falcon and Timothy Kane who are serving life sentences for felony murder in Florida, state with highest number of juvenile offenders serving life sentences, 600; juvenile lifers are overwhelmingly male and mostly black and are more likely to be in for murder than their adult counterparts; number of juveniles sentenced to life without parole peaked in 1996, at 152, and has dropped sharply since then, to 54 in 2004; photos (L)

VLarry Moore sat outside the shelter in his wheelchair, grumbling that he was not like the others inside, the sick ones. He was shot in the stomach more than a decade ago, he said, protecting a young woman as her boyfriend tried to attack her. ''You save someone's life and this is what you get -- nothing,'' said Mr. Moore, 31, a stocky former cook who is eager to talk to anyone who will listen. ''You get treated like an animal. You get nothing here.''

VThe question of assisted suicide reached the Supreme Court for the second time in eight years on Wednesday, although the profound issues of professional ethics and personal autonomy that have animated the national debate largely remained outside the courtroom. Instead, lawyers for the federal government and for Oregon, the only state to have authorized physician-assisted suicide, argued over a single question: whether John Ashcroft acted within his authority as attorney general when he decided in 2001 that doctors would lose their federal prescription privileges if they followed the Oregon law's procedures and prescribed lethal doses of lawful medications for terminally ill patients who wanted to end their own lives.

VQuestion of assisted suicide reaches Supreme Court for second time in eight years, although only on narrow issue; lawyers for federal government and for Oregon, only state to have authorized physician-assisted suicide, argue over single question: whether then-Atty Gen John Ashcroft acted within his authority when he decided in 2001 that doctors would lose their federal prescription privileges if they followed Oregon law's procedures and prescribed lethal doses of lawful medications for terminally ill patients who wanted to end their own lives; this straighforward question of federal administrative law will not visit profound issues of professional ethics and personal autonomy that have animated national debate on physician-assisted suicide; despite clearly confined scope of issue before court, deep questions of social policy and of federal-state relations attract dozens of briefs for both sides from medical professionals, elected officials, and religious and policy organizations (M)

VAgainst the backdrop of reports of a new terrorist threat to New York City, the mayoral debate at the Apollo Theater in Harlem last night abounded in attacks on Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his decision not to participate, even as voters seemed sure to be focusing on his warnings about security. The debate itself, the first televised head-to-head of the general election, was a mild affair, thanks to the lack of the leading candidate, Mr. Bloomberg. The Democratic nominee, Fernando Ferrer, made his standard case about improving education and the city's housing stock, while turning repeatedly to the lectern meant for the mayor and chiding him for staying away.

VOVER the last few years, William F. Buckley Jr., who lives in Stamford, has divested himself of many of his trademark possessions and pursuits. He abandoned his pioneering television talk show, ''Firing Line,'' after 35 years on the air; gave up control of National Review, the opinion journal he founded in 1955; canceled his annual writing trip to Switzerland because he no longer skis; and sold his beloved sailboat, Patito. Now Mr. Buckley is ending yet another long-running pursuit. ''Last Call for Blackford Oakes,'' his 11th spy novel featuring Oakes, a fictional C.I.A. agent, will be the final book in the series. As Mr. Buckley closes out these various parts of his storied past, a passage he wrote in an article for The Atlantic Monthly last year, about selling his boat, assumes greater weight. He told readers that the decision to give up sailing ''is not lightly taken, bringing to mind a step yet ahead, which is giving up life itself.''

VDECIDING how to inhabit the character of Celia Hodes, a bossy, lonely housewife on Showtime's ''Weeds,'' Elizabeth Perkins concentrated on the hair. ''She's desperately trying to be younger,'' Ms. Perkins said in a recent telephone interview. ''She's probably had that same hairstyle since she was 21, and that's very important to her.'' For the pilot, that meant a blond dye job, but the character's Farrah mane was more high-maintenance than Ms. Perkins, a 44-year-old mother with a house in Hollywood and a daughter in high school, could manage. Now a perfectly smooth wig stays at the ready.

''Tattoos,'' ''marijuana,'' ''the Bible,'' and ''Las Vegas'' are no longer counted in the weekly top 50 list because they are too broad.

VWhen the Miami Dolphins' defense heads to the sideline between possessions, Vonnie Holliday normally sits on the bench to rest, paying little attention to the offense. That routine will change on Sunday when Ricky Williams makes his season debut against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. ''I can only imagine when he touches the ball for the first time,'' Holliday, the veteran defensive end, said Wednesday after practice. ''He has a lot to prove. I think he has a lot of built-up frustration and this is going to be the way he's going to get it out. The way I see it, he has worked so hard for this moment, the opportunity. I don't think he's going to be denied.''

VThe inmates, bleary from trying to sleep on a fenced-in chunk of pavement outside the bus and train station in New Orleans, parade upstairs to the makeshift courtroom, their hands in white plastic cuffs. The prosecutor hustles up from his office -- aka the Taste of New Orleans gift shop -- where his file folders now share the display window with bottles of hot sauce and plastic ladles that say ''Cooking with Jazz.'' The magistrate judge, Gerard J. Hansen, is making do behind an old desk, briskly setting bail for some of the 1,100 people arrested in the metropolitan area since Hurricane Katrina hit on Aug. 29.

VMiami Dolphins running back Ricky Williams returns Sunday after a four-game suspension for violating the National Football League's substance-abuse policy, the latest of several cases involving the league that raise questions for all sports about what drug testing can reasonably be expected to accomplish. While Congress has heavily criticized Major League Baseball for its drug-testing policy, those same lawmakers have praised the N.F.L., whose program is regarded by drug experts as the best among professional sports leagues in the United States.

VA St. George man has been arrested in connection with the rape of a 15-year-old Staten Island girl in 1999 after being linked to the crime by DNA, according to the Richmond County district attorney, Daniel M. Donovan Jr. Mr. Donovan, left, said yesterday that a DNA sample from Lee Calvin, 36, that was on file in the state's database was matched with DNA taken from the victim. Mr. Calvin was placed under arrest yesterday morning in St. George by members of the police warrant squad, under a bench warrant issued last month for failure to pay a $370 fine on a marijuana possession conviction. He was later arrested by investigators from the district attorney's office in connection with the rape, which took place in a boardinghouse at 122 Central Avenue. The police said that about 2 a.m. on April 29, 1999, the victim was punched and dragged from a sidewalk in the vicinity of Bay Street and Victory Boulevard to the boardinghouse, where she was raped.

VIN the summer of 1944, Max Ernst shared a summer house on Long Island with the art dealer Julien Levy. Ernst was the first to arrive, with Dorothea Tanning, the painter who would become his fourth wife, and he sent a postcard to Levy back in New York: ''No chess set available at the village store.'' If Ernst had found one in town, it probably would have been a Staunton set, the style that was endorsed in 1849 by the British chess champion Howard Staunton and that has become standard for elementary school lessons and international tournaments alike. But throughout the history of chess, its pieces have taken every shape, from intricate Gothic figurines to abstract Islamic forms to prisoners' bread crusts. So Ernst and Levy decided to make their own.

VNo matter how hard the Minnesota Vikings try to avoid the subject, nautical reminders are everywhere. A replica Viking ship, a symbol of the franchise, faces the entrance to the team's Winter Park complex. A corporate sponsor parked a trailer with a speedboat within sight of the Vikings' practice field. During a 28-3 loss to the Bears on Sunday in Chicago, Vikings players said, they saw signs and heard derisive comments about the Oct. 6 boating incident on Lake Minnetonka that made the Vikings a national joke. One of the worst was a banner depicting a Viking ship with the message, ''Sink the Vikings, but save the strippers.''

Even so, it spans nearly a thousand pages and is longer than major new biographies of Mao and Abraham Lincoln. Why?

VTwenty-one people have been arrested in connection with the sale of drugs along a stretch of Post Avenue between Dyckman and 204th Streets in Inwood, the police said yesterday. The arrests, made last week, followed a yearlong investigation in which undercover officers made 28 purchases of illegal drugs from two groups along the avenue, said Bridget Brennan, the special narcotics prosecutor. Ms. Brennan said the groups sold cocaine and a high-potency strain of marijuana called purple haze. The area, which became known as the Home of the Haze, has had 11 shootings and four homicides in the past nine months, Ms. Brennan said.

VA 16-year-old boy was arrested by sheriff's deputies Wednesday night in Lafayette in the killing of Pamela Vitale, the wife of Daniel Horowitz, a well-known criminal defense lawyer, who had been in the middle of a high-profile murder case. Ms. Vitale was killed Saturday morning in the couple's remote home in Lafayette, while her husband was away. According to The San Francisco Chronicle's Web site, the teen-ager had stolen credit-card receipts and ordered marijuana-growing equipment to be sent to the Horowitz home. When the boy arrived at the home, he fought with Ms. Vitale, hitting her 39 times in the head with crown molding, according to The Chronicle. Carol Pogash (NYT)

VThere is surely a reason Jon Stewart doesn't give his nightly report on ''The Daily Show'' to the accompaniment of bongo drums. Bongo drums just aren't cool, dude, and probably haven't been since some time in the early 1960's. But there they are, two sleekly bulging gourds glimpsed through the big Venetian blind that forms the backdrop for ''Ashley Montana Goes Ashore in the Caicos or: What Am I Doing Here?'' at the Flea Theater. (Yes, percussion sticklers, I know these are technically conga drums, but the principle holds.)

VTELL me: In what ski store, anywhere in the country, could you buy a bag that is specially designed to hide your drugs? This is perhaps the most striking difference between skiing and snowboarding, two sports so culturally opposed that the only thing they share is a winter slope. Ski stores sell expensive Austrian sweaters with snowflake designs. In the new Burton store, you can buy a kit bag for your marijuana. You can also buy a jacket into which you can plug an iPod, a purse for one-night stands and a knapsack that doubles as a traveling bar, complete with martini shaker.

VHarriet E Miers withdraws her nomination for Supreme Court after withering attacks from conservatives and weeks of doubt from both political parties about her qualifications for the job; Pres Bush says he 'reluctantly accepted' Miers's decision; he must now find new nominee at time of growing disarray at White House; Miers is expected to remain in her job as White House counsel; Bush and Miers cite principle of separation of powers as reason for withdrawal, claiming releasing documents requested by Senate about her work in White House would weaken independence of executive branch; members of both parties disagree, saying most powerful factor was strong opposition from conservatives who questioned her ideology on social issues and see her as impediment to their decades-long goal of control of court; photos (M)

VHERE'S a question about the televised debate scheduled for Sunday between those dynamic speakers, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his Democratic opponent, Fernando Ferrer: Who do they think will be watching them at 9 a.m.? At that hour on a Sunday, many New Yorkers are running in the park, heading to church, buying bagels or sleeping off a hard night of clubbing.

VMarion S. Barry Jr., a former mayor who is now on the City Council, pleaded guilty in federal court to two misdemeanor charges of failing to file his 2000 income tax returns. Mr. Barry, 69, could face 18 months in prison and a $25,000 fine. As part of the plea agreement, Mr. Barry asked for probation; he provided no explanation for not filing. Mr. Barry served three terms as mayor from 1978 to 1990, before spending six months in prison for drug possession, and another term from 1994 to 1998. In 2002, his bid for a seat on the City Council ended after the United States Park Police reported finding small amounts of crack cocaine and marijuana in his illegally parked car. No charges were filed in that case. Voters returned him to the council in 2004. John Files (NYT)

VIT used to be said that the reports of presidential commissions sat on shelves and gathered dust. The Internet made such shelves obsolete, but only the repository has changed. After President Bush's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform, having spent nine months and at least $1.5 million, submits its final report on Tuesday, a well-practiced routine will be followed. The president will thank the commission members for their diligence. The members will call a news conference to toast their collegial experience. Lobbyists and others with a particular interest in tax policy will weigh in. Articles will be written for a day or two.

Less than 10 feet outside her building, a man with a shaved head was bending over a scrawny sapling and rummaging in the grass at its base. When he straightened up, he held a small plastic bag in his hands.

VAlmost from the moment he walked into my office, something bothered me about my 18-year-old patient, Mark, sent to see me by his parents after they found marijuana and steroids in his bedroom. He was tall and muscular, with tousled, dirty-blonde hair, outfitted in a faded T-shirt emblazoned with the words ''Sunset Strip,'' distressed jeans made to look threadbare at midthigh and along the edges of the pockets and a 70's retro leather choker with a few clay beads on it.

VThe reasoning in Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr.'s decisions is mostly methodical, dry and respectful of precedent, but the technical quality of his writing can mask bold and solidly conservative conclusions on issues like abortion, gun control and the death penalty. President Bush's last two nominees to the Supreme Court had nothing like Judge Alito's enormous judicial track record. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.'s brief tenure on the federal appeals court in Washington before his recent elevation gave rise to few memorable decisions, and Harriet E. Miers's lack of judicial experience may have played a role in the withdrawal of her nomination.

VThe national movement to impose caps on state taxes and spending took a sharp blow in Tuesday's election, conservatives and liberals say, when Colorado voters decided that the tightest spending cap in the nation was just a tad too tight. A statewide ballot proposition, Referendum C, approved by about 52 percent of the voters, will allow state government to keep a projected $3.7 billion over the next five years. The money would otherwise have been refunded to residents under what is called the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights, which was put into Colorado's Constitution in 1992. A second proposal that would have allowed the state to borrow up to $2.1 billion for roads, school maintenance and other projects was narrowly defeated.

VThe son of John F. Timoney, the former New York City first deputy police commissioner, was charged on Tuesday with trying to buy 400 pounds of marijuana from an undercover federal agent, the Drug Enforcement Administration said yesterday. A court complaint said Sean Timoney, 25, of Philadelphia, gave the agent a gym bag filled with $450,000 in cash. Mr. Timoney and Jae Seu, 23, of Glenside, Pa., were arrested on Tuesday night in Spring Valley, in Rockland County. John Timoney is now chief of police in Miami. ''He does not have all the details, and he's not going to comment on it publicly because it's a private family matter,'' said Delrish Moss, a Miami police spokesman.

VJay Leno According to the latest poll, if George Bush ran for president today he would lose to the Democratic candidate. President Bush said, ''Again?'' This is an interesting survey. Fifty-four percent of lawyers said they would not represent a terrorist. The other 46 percent said they would represent them, but only as a professional courtesy.

VPROUD are the parents whose college-bound children choose to live in ''substance-free'' or ''wellness'' dorms. Residents voluntarily commit not to smoke, drink or use drugs and, in some cases, eschew loud music and pets, too. Well, not always entirely voluntarily: a good many times, it is really the parents who choose substance-free living or at least nudge their sons and daughters in that direction.

VWhen the jewelry company De Beers held a dinner to celebrate the opening of its Fifth Avenue flagship last June, the company persuaded Thomas Keller to cater the event. There was the usual round of preparty consultations about courses and foodstuffs and order of service, but there were also, it should be said without exaggeration, at least four meetings between the party planners and Keller's staff before they could agree on the seemingly straightforward matter of which plates to employ. The reason for this is as simple and as complicated as the plates themselves -- severe white ramekins and square service pieces imported from France for the occasion. It is this: Keller is a dish queen, as persnickety about the quality, the pedigree and the artistic attributes of the vessels on which his food is served as he is about his cuisine.

VThe seventh floor of Covenant House in Manhattan resembles a college dorm. A dozen stereos blast music into a hallway where young men come and go with backpacks slung over baggy T-shirts. But Covenant House is a shelter that serves homeless or at-risk young men. The seventh floor is their temporary home as part of Rites of Passage, a transitional living program for men and women ages 18 to 21, a place where they can learn how to live and succeed on their own.

VThe Santa Cruz City Council gave final approval to an ordinance that would establish a city-run medical marijuana program. The measure, written with guidance from the American Civil Liberties Union, includes a clause that delays the start of the program until the federal courts rule on it. Sponsors of the ordinance said it would serve as a test for what city officials believe to be states' constitutional right to opt out of joining the federal government's recent efforts to close medical marijuana dispensaries. Mayor Mike Rotkin said, ''We want to help medical marijuana patients obtain their medicine while also protecting them from the undesirable consequences of an unregulated black market.''

VAmin Kouidri, 20, has been hunting for a job for more than two years now and spends his days drifting around a government housing project here under the watchful gaze of France's national police. He and his neighbors in one of France's now-notorious housing projects say that they feel cut off from French society, a result of a process of segregation lasting for decades, and that alienation and pressure from the police have now exploded in rage across the country.

VAmin Kouidri, 20-year-old ethnic North African, and neighbors in housing project in Evry describe being unable to find jobs and feeling cut off from French society because of segregation that has lasted for decades; some have turned to religion, which reassures older generation but worries officials and adds to fears of Islamic extremism; men in projects say police circle apartment blocks, stopping and searching them and putting on riot gear at night as cat-and-mouse clashes erupt; projects were built in 1960's as part of postwar urban planning dream, drawing people from cramped old homes in provinces and cities and then immigrants; early days were optimistic but most of native French moved out in 1980's home-buying program; immigrants and their French-born children remained, resenting lack of opportunities in country that has largest non-European immigrant population in Europe but only handful of minorities in senior positions; graphs; French of West African and North African descent drew into increasingly closed world of few jobs and increasing crime, which led to crackdown under Pres Jacques Chirac and his tough interior minister, Nicolas Sarkozy (M)

VA 16-month-old Brooklyn boy drowned in a filthy tub in a bathroom with no working light on Sunday while his mother spent 40 minutes in the next room playing CD's, prosecutors said yesterday as the city's Administration for Children's Services said it was starting its own full investigation of its handling of the troubled family. Prosecutors said the boy, Dahquay Gillians, was found face-up in the bathtub by his mother, Tracina Vaughn. They said her companion checked on Dahquay and his brother, Tramel Vaughn, after arriving at her apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant on Sunday evening and, thinking that the 16-month old was behind a shower curtain, left briefly to buy diapers and beer.

VFor the second time in eight months, a prisoner escaped from custody in Fulton County on Thursday morning, setting off a major manhunt. The prisoner, James Henderson, 25, was being held Thursday on felony charges of marijuana possession, child endangerment and reckless conduct when he escaped on foot from the Fulton County Jail into the nearby Vine City neighborhood, officials from the Atlanta Police Department and the Fulton County Sheriff's Department said.

He turned to one side, then the other, then back again, twisting to look behind him in the cubbies where he had stashed some belongings. Nothing.

VIt's an on-the-job hazard: going into private spaces every day exposes some activities and habits that would be better not exposed to public view. Starting, of course, with sex.

VOfficers arrested a Hillburn, N.Y., man, identified as Shawn Chance, 23, after he was stopped yesterday on the George Washington Bridge with 600 pounds of marijuana worth $1 million, the Port Authority police said. They said they pulled over Mr. Chance because he was driving on the bridge's lower level, where trucks are not permitted. He was charged with possession of and intent to distribute marijuana.

VIn developing its dramatic series celebrating lesbian friendships and lifestyles, Showtime chose the perfect title: ''The L Word.'' Can viewers handle a show with ''lesbian'' in the title? Or is the network winking at those who can? Either way, Showtime used an increasingly popular construction. Well beyond the F-word we all grew up forbidden to utter, every letter of the alphabet now seems up for grabs to euphemize something unspeakable. Examples of all 26 can be found in the conventional press from the last 12 months. ALAN SCHWARZ

VThe television personality Nicole Richie sat at a table in Times Square's Virgin Megastore last week with a pen in her hand, a smile on her face and butterflies in her stomach. Seeing as this was Ms. Richie's first book signing -- her debut novel, ''The Truth About Diamonds,'' hit stores last Monday -- she said she was a tad nervous. But in a matter of minutes it would become clear that she had little to worry about. That night she was among friends, friends who were more than willing to shell out for a book (list: $23.95). ''She's the most amazing person I've ever seen on TV in my life,'' gushed one teenage girl, who was near tears. ''I live for her. I'd do anything to talk to her.''

VNathan Tylutki arrived late in New York, tired but eager to go out dancing. When his friend Katherine K. offered him the Ritalin she had inherited from someone who had stopped taking his prescription, he popped two pills and stayed out all night. For the two college friends, now 25 and out in the working world, there was nothing remarkable about the transaction. A few weeks later, Katherine gave the tranquilizer Ativan to another friend who complained of feeling short of breath and panicky.

VArticle in series Being a Patient discusses behavior of people in their 20s and 30's who decide on their own what drugs to take, diagnosing themselves and friends and sharing prescription drugs to treat problems ranging from depression and anxiety to fatigue and lack of concentration; Nathan Tylutki describes getting Ritalin to stay up from friend who freely admits getting unused medications from others and dispensing them to friends after she decides what they need; such people trade unused prescription drugs, get them without prescription over Internet and sometimes lie to doctors about ailments; experts warn that infrmaation on dosages, risks and potential interaction dangers get lost as pills are passed around but they are flummoxed about how to address problem; consumer drug ads allowed by FDA since 1997 also send message that pills offer cure for every ill and that use is largely matter of personal choice; Casey Greenfield, 32-year-old Los Angeles writer, explains how she dictates to her doctors what to prescribe; photos (M)

VPolice officers driving to investigate a report of a man on a corner with a gun early yesterday struck and killed a pedestrian in Harlem as he stepped out into the street, the police said. The pedestrian, Adam Perez, 31, who lived on Manhattan Avenue, was taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, where he was declared dead at 1:55 a.m., about 25 minutes after he was struck.

VNICK GOOSSEN'S apprenticeship as a director began at the age of 3. He would watch his father train prizefighters in a gym here, a dark, cramped, oddly angled soundstage for polished pros and battered tomato cans. While the boxers worked the rope and hit the mitts, Hollywood Joe Goossen would orchestrate the action. When the old man turned on the lights above the ring, it was like lifting the curtain at Radio City Music Hall. Even the most punchless palooka was bathed in romantic glamour as he sparred. Twenty-four years later, Nick Goossen is about to make his directing debut with ''Grandma's Boy,'' a stoner comedy that was shot in 25 days on a budget of $5 million for the production company of his mentor, Adam Sandler. ''Grandma's Boy'' may have the best advance buzz of any pothead project since ''Friday,'' a low-budget laugh that smoked up theaters in 1995 and mushroomed into two sequels.

VIn America, strict grammarians may bemoan the effects of popular culture on the standards of spoken English. In China, however, the latest fad in the huge market for English instruction comes in the form of ''Action English,'' a television show that uses clips from Hollywood movies to teach what it calls ''American slang.'' Sometimes, the lessons are straightforward enough. Take for example, Episode 139, which introduced the word ''hit,'' used in the vernacular sense, and illustrated with the 1999 film ''The Thomas Crown Affair.'' The scene in question finds two detectives walking through the darkened halls of a museum, where a Monet had just been purloined. One turns to the other and asks, ''This place been hit before?''

VResponding to a domestic violence call last April at an apartment in this city's largest housing project, Officer Joe Poggioli Jr. flipped on his flashlight, peered into a bedroom, and saw two boys huddled together on a bed. Cockroaches were crawling all over one wall and the bedsheets. One inched across the face of the younger boy. Officer Poggioli, a 25-year veteran of the police force here, had seen other run-down apartments like this one. Thick layers of peeling paint hung from the walls. The faucet leaked. A musty odor mingled with the sweet smell of marijuana in the hallway. A mouse scurried across the floor. The door of the refrigerator hung open -- no matter, it did not work anyway.

VBy the end of his junior year at Miami Killian High School, Demetrice Morley flashed the speed, size and talent of a top college football prospect. His classroom performance, however, failed to match his athletic skills. He received three F's that year and had a 2.09 grade point average in his core courses, giving him little hope of qualifying for a scholarship under National Collegiate Athletic Association guidelines.

VFor the earth, it was just a twinge. Last Dec. 26, at 7:59 a.m., one part of the planet's undersea crust made an abrupt shift beneath another along a 750-mile seam near the island of Sumatra. The tectonic plates had been grating against each other for millenniums, and now the higher of the two was lifted perhaps 60 feet. For a planet where landmasses are in constant motion across geological time, the event was of no great moment. But for people -- who mark the calendar in days and months rather than eons -- a monumental catastrophe had begun, not only the largest earthquake in 40 years but also the displacement of billions of tons of water, unleashing a series of mammoth waves: a tsunami. These surging mounds of water raced toward land with the speed of a jet aircraft and then slowed as they reared up to leap ashore at heights of 50 feet and higher. They were long as well as tall, stampeding inland and carrying with them all they were destroying. People caught in the waves became small ingredients in an enormous blender, bludgeoned by concrete slabs and felled trees, stabbed by jagged sheets of glass, tangled up in manacles of wire.

VThe Autobiography of Donovan The Hurdy Gurdy Man By Donovan Leitch. Illustrated. 287 pages. St. Martin's Press. $24.95. In his prime, the astral singer-songwriter Donovan appeared to take a serene view of show business and its cutthroat ways. Not anymore. Nowadays, Donovan would like you to know that he never received proper credit for Flower Power, World Music, New Age Music, the boxed-set album package, using LSD and the lyric ''Love, Love, Love'' before the Beatles did and playing folk-rock five months before Bob Dylan wielded an electric guitar at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival.

VWhen two officers turned on their turret light and siren and pulled a U-turn on a Brooklyn street early Monday, they most likely had no inkling that they might be trailing a man who had reasons to resist being caught. The driver, Allan Cameron, was wanted for assaulting officers in Pennsylvania two years ago, had 53 small bags of marijuana in his car, and was carrying a loaded 9-millimeter handgun, the authorities said. And just nine days before, the police said, he robbed an off-duty officer in Brooklyn, stealing his jewelry and police identification card before shooting him in the shoulder.

VDressed in a gray prison jumpsuit and rubber slippers, Allan Cameron, 27, the man accused of killing a New York City police officer in Brooklyn early Monday morning and wounding another officer nine days before, sat in a jail cell yesterday and described himself as a longtime drug user, a man with multiple girlfriends and someone with an appetite for hard partying. ''I smoke weed morning till night, like everyone in the ghetto,'' Mr. Cameron said. ''I'm Jamaican. We don't use those other fancy drugs.''

VWhen a police officer dies in the line of duty, there is a natural desire to look for ways to prevent such tragedies in the future. Gov. George Pataki responded to the fatal shooting of Officer Dillon Stewart this week with a call for reinstating the death penalty. That is unlikely to save the lives of officers who find themselves facing violent suspects. Most potential cop killers are not the kind of people likely to consider the consequences of their worst impulses. The allegations about the man accused of killing Officer Stewart -- that he was a man already wanted by the authorities who sped through a traffic light while carrying 53 bags of marijuana -- provide a perfect description of a person who would not be prudent enough to resist grabbing a handy gun. Rather than increasing the potential consequence of a shooting, it would be far better to remove the gun. The rising amount of gun violence in New York City, which has some of the toughest gun control laws in the country, demonstrates a basic fact: states and localities can make rules on where and how their residents may carry guns, but the regulation of the sales and trafficking of those deadly weapons needs to be done on a federal level.

VA federal jury acquitted the hip-hop impresario Irv Gotti and his brother of money-laundering charges late yesterday, prompting jubilant cheers and pandemonium in the packed courtroom in Brooklyn. The verdict ended a three-year ordeal for the two men and dealt a stunning blow to federal prosecutors. Minutes after the verdicts were read at the end of the second day of deliberations, two women on the jury asked that the brothers be brought into the jury room, where they hugged them. Then they asked for the men's parents, and hugged them, too.

VJamal Crawford was at home, and with that scheduling happenstance came a privilege accorded to all of Coach Larry Brown's players. Crawford, the former starter and reluctant reserve, had the option to start in front of family and friends. Crawford thanked Brown, but declined the token gesture and instead fashioned his own sort of homecoming party. With a season-high 31 points, 19 in the fourth quarter, Crawford paced the Knicks to an improbable comeback and a 104-101 victory over the Seattle SuperSonics to open a three-game road trip.

VOur secretary of state's tortuous defense of supposedly nonexistent C.I.A. torture chambers in Eastern Europe was an acid flashback to Clintonian parsing. Just as Bill Clinton, during the '92 campaign, pranced around questions about marijuana use at Oxford by saying he had never broken the laws of his country, so Condoleezza Rice pranced around questions about outsourcing torture by suggesting that President Bush had never broken the laws of his country.

VThe New Jersey attorney general yesterday directed the state's police departments to adopt uniform guidelines for first-time juvenile offenders charged with minor infractions to keep them out of court and free of a police record. The directive grew out of a survey of local police in which 356 departments reported that they were already using various mechanisms to keep juveniles picked up on minor violations from going to court.

V''Do you think we sell more books or CD's?'' That was the first question Paul Wright, 49, asked his former vocational counselor, Todd Stowe, during a recent visit to the third-floor computer lab at the Neighborhood Center for Homeless People on 237 East 77th Street. It was his first time back at the center since he graduated from the workforce training program last year, and he was overcome by nostalgia. ''This is new,'' he said, tapping a gray plastic glare guard that covered a computer screen. ''Everything else, it's pretty much the same,'' he added, referring to the computers that sat atop gray rectangular tables and the stacks of books on shelves labeled ''inventory.'' Uncategorized merchandise was stored in oversize brown boxes on the floor.

VCombine a gripe against glitzy Pop objects, no money, a yen for the new and maybe a little marijuana, and you have a possible recipe for how and why video became art in the 1970's. Even with chemicals factored in, though, today's art audience must wonder at the patience that some of those early videos demanded of viewers, with their minimal content spun out for many grainy minutes and hours. It was as if art were saying: this is not Hollywood or television. This is not entertainment (though sometimes it was). This is serious. This is work.

VAfter decades of drug addiction, Adriane Allen believes she has finally grown too old to smoke crack. At 57, she has chest pains, has lost most of her teeth and has trouble moving her arms. Lately, she worries about how her grandchildren will remember her when she is gone. ''I definitely do not want them mourning me as an addict, that I died as an addict,'' said Ms. Allen, shaking her head, covered with gray hair and fidgeting uncontrollably during an interview at a New York City needle-exchange center.

VThe first time that young Lillo Brancato Jr. is remembered setting foot on the quiet street of homes on Arnow Place in the Bronx was around 1993. Then, he was a cocksure teenager starring opposite his big-screen idol, Robert De Niro, in ''A Bronx Tale.'' He and a 9-year-old actor, Francis Capra, played the same character at different stages of his life in the film, and Francis lived on Arnow Place. On the film's set, Mr. Brancato met Francis's older sister, Chanel, and courted her, thereby becoming a regular visitor to the block.

VELEVEN years before he won Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark school desegregation case, Thurgood Marshall came to Rockland County in 1943 to fight for integration at an elementary school in the Village of Hillburn. This month, Rockland County officials recalled that moment in history and inducted Mr. Marshall, the Supreme Court justice, who died in 1993, into its Civil Rights Hall of Fame. His widow, Cecilia Marshall, traveled from her home in Virginia to attend the ceremony in which the county's Human Rights Commission was renamed the Rosa Parks Human Rights Commission. Rockland offered him ''one of his first cases in breaking down segregation in the elementary schools,'' Mrs. Marshall, 77, said in a telephone interview. ''I made sure that when they inducted my husband, they also honored the courageous students and their parents, because they are the real heroes in the case. My husband always said, 'I come in and leave on a train, but people who live in a community have to stay there and fight. They are the ones who struggle.' ''

VIT was a cold night in a quiet Staten Island neighborhood, but Christ Episcopal Church, a Gothic Revival marvel of gray limestone and stained glass, was full of people and light and singing. The lights were of the klieg variety, though, and many of the well-scrubbed people had been hired to fill the pews. The occasion was a recent filming of ''The Book of Daniel, '' a new NBC drama scheduled to have its premiere on Jan. 6. The show stars Aidan Quinn as the Rev. Daniel Webster, a sometimes petulant, sometimes befuddled, Vicodin-addicted Episcopal minister, husband and father who wants to do right. Daniel not only prays to Jesus, but also talks to a flesh-and-blood, long-haired guy in a flowing robe, a kind of heavenly Dr. Phil no one else sees. Jesus pops up at Daniel's sprawling home (in a prosperous New York suburb) or sits beside him in his car, admonishing him not to tailgate or be so judgmental.

VCarlos Urquilla said he felt lucky when he was hired a year ago to be a dean at Decker College here. A former Army lieutenant straight out of law school, Mr. Urquilla liked the way the school sold itself as a place to help poor students learn a trade. But in his first weeks at the for-profit school, Mr. Urquilla says, he found employees falsifying student attendance records, instructors helping students to cheat and recruiters arranging federal loans for students who could not read.

VThe 13-year-old boy sat in his California home, eyes fixed on a computer screen. He had never run with the popular crowd and long ago had turned to the Internet for the friends he craved. But on this day, Justin Berry's fascination with cyberspace would change his life. Weeks before, Justin had hooked up a Web camera to his computer, hoping to use it to meet other teenagers online. Instead, he heard only from men who chatted with him by instant message as they watched his image on the Internet. To Justin, they seemed just like friends, ready with compliments and always offering gifts.

VSpecial report, A Hidden World: sordid world of online child pornography has emerged largely without attracting attention of law enforcement or youth protection organizations; minors are opening for-pay pornography sites featuring their own images sent onto Internet by inexpensive Webcams; adults spend time 'grooming' youths with praise, attention and gifts before seeking to persuade them to film themselves pornographically; children perform from privacy of home, while parents nearby are unaware of activity beyond children's closed bedroom doors; businesses, some witting and some unwitting, provide services to sites like Web hosting and payment processing; scale of Webcam child pornography is unknown, because it is new and extremely secretive; entry requires only a Webcam, which costs as little as $20; instant messaging programs have become ubiquitous and high-speed connections allow for rapid image transmissions; Justin Berry describes in detail his experiences as online child porn star, beginning when he was 13; after turning 18, going from under-age victim to adult perpetrator, he cooperated with FBI in sting operation that resulted in arrest of Greg Mitchel, his 38-year-old business partner on his pornography Web site; Berry became federal witness and was granted immunity; photos; charts; description of how The Times conducted inquiry (L)

VAlcohol use and cigarette smoking among teenagers are at historic lows, but the number of high school students abusing prescription drugs like Oxycontin is rising, and sedative abuse is at its highest in 26 years, according to an annual national study released yesterday. Asked whether they had used tranquilizers, barbiturates or sedatives for nonmedical use in the last year, 14 percent of high school seniors, 11 percent of 10th graders, and 7 percent of 8th graders said yes, according to the Monitoring the Future study, which the federal government considers the best benchmark of teenage drug use.

Andretti's son, Marco, 19, will become a third-generation Andretti driver with a full-time spot in the Indy Racing League for Andretti Green Racing. The team is co-owned by Michael Andretti.

VCHAD DAWSON grew up in New Haven and used to spend a lot of time at Ring One Boxing, a gym where youngsters from some of the city's poorest neighborhoods go to sweat and dream of one day becoming big-time fighters. But these days, he does not go by there much anymore. His newly hired trainer operates in St. Petersburg, Fla., where Dawson, now 23, has been preparing for his next fight, on Feb. 4 in El Paso. The sunshine and the chance to spar with world champions have him thinking of a permanent relocation.

VEvery Thursday evening, I counsel a group of teenagers with serious substance abuse problems. None of the youngsters elected to see me. Typically, they were caught using drugs, or worse, by their parents or a police officer and were then referred to my clinic. To be sure, all the usual intoxicants -- alcohol, marijuana, amphetamines, LSD and cocaine -- are involved. But a new type of addiction has crept into the mix, controlled prescription drugs, including potent opiate painkillers, tranquilizers and stimulants used to treat attention deficit disorders.

VFor most aspiring rappers, the fastest route to having material circulated around the World Wide Web is to produce a work that is radical, cutting-edge and, in a word, cool. But now a pair of ''Saturday Night Live'' performers turned unexpected hip-hop icons are discovering that Internet stardom may be more easily achieved by being as nerdy as possible. In ''Lazy Sunday,'' a music video that had its debut on the Dec. 17 broadcast of ''SNL,'' two cast members, Chris Parnell and Andy Samberg, adopt the brash personas of head-bopping, hand-waving rappers. But as they make their way around Manhattan's West Village, they rhyme with conviction about subjects that are anything but hard-core: they boast about eating cupcakes from the Magnolia Bakery, searching for travel directions on MapQuest and achieving their ultimate goal of attending a matinee of the fantasy movie ''The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.''

VSome years ago we had a criminal prosecution in Scotland of a man who was found to have a small quantity of marijuana in one of the pockets of his golf bag. These days the police hardly concern themselves with such cases, but at the time the possession of even barely detectable quantities of controlled drugs was a more serious matter. His defense was simple. He had placed it there some years before and forgotten about it. This did him no good. He was convicted. Some may feel sympathy for him; other may not. But whatever one's view on the outcome, this case raises interesting issues of whether you can be said to possess something that you have forgotten you have.

Detectives were tipped off after the mother of a Farmington High School student saw an advertisement for the marijuana, with a photograph and text, while using his cellphone, the police said. She notified the police, who obtained warrants to monitor cellphone calls and messages from the suspects and also began to watch them.

VThe Greenpoint Hotel is still listed in a few tourist guides, which promise cheap rooms and warn of the brusque if efficient staff. But few map-carrying bargain-hunters stay there these days. The hallways stink of marijuana and urine; the bathrooms -- one per floor -- are caked in dirt, and hot water is rare. The front desk is barricaded shut with sheets of plywood. Theft and violence are a constant threat. ''My room is a box -- it's the size of a prison cell,'' one resident, Jaime Rodriguez, said as he stood outside a deli near the hotel recently, swaying slightly, his eyes cloudy. Mr. Rodriguez said he had lived at the Greenpoint for a decade, paying rent with disability checks. ''This whole place is a prison,'' he said.

VRhode Island has become the first state to enact a law sanctioning the use of medical marijuana since the Supreme Court ruled in June that the authorities could prosecute users, even in states with laws that allow its use. The State House of Representatives overrode the veto of Gov. Donald L. Carcieri, a Republican who rejected the measure last year, 59 to 13. Rhode Island is the 11th state to allow the use of marijuana for medical purposes. KATIE ZEZIMA (NYT)

V9 P.M. (NBC) THE BOOK OF DANIEL -- His daughter is arrested for marijuana possession. His son wants to cure cancer for the wrong reasons. His brother-in-law has disappeared, along with some church-school funds. Thank heaven the Rev. Daniel Webster (Aidan Quinn, above) has someone to talk to: Jesus (Garret Dillahunt), who is a cast regular in this new drama series. A second episode being shown tonight is mostly about sex. 8 P.M. (CBS) GHOST WHISPERER -- Sometimes ghosts really do want to kill you. That's what Melinda (Jennifer Love Hewitt) has to deal with tonight. Her new neighbor is not only being haunted; his ghost (the grandfather of a friend) is out for revenge. Guest stars include Dominique Swain (Jeremy Irons's young co-star in Adrian Lyne's ''Lolita'') and Jonathan Banks. 8 TO 11 P.M. (Sci Fi) Three outer-space series are back with new episodes, beginning with ''Stargate SG-1,'' now in the bottom half of its ninth season. Its characters are dealing with a plague. At 9, ''Stargate Atlantis'' returns with a story about hostages on a Wraith ship. (The Wraith are zombielike aliens; their queen, left, is played by Andee Frizzell.) And at 10, the good guys of ''Battlestar Galactica'' join forces to destroy a Cylon target. (The Cylon are a robot race. They started out as servants but rose up and defeated their masters.) 8 P.M. (ABC) DANCING WITH THE STARS -- This is the ''results show,'' when we learn how viewers voted after the season premiere on Thursday. 8:30 P.M. (Fox) MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE -- From the beginning (January 2000), one of the strengths of this sitcom has been that the parents aren't always perfect or noble. Sometimes they're not even sensible. Tonight a $10,000 check made out to Malcolm (Frankie Muniz) arrives, and after due consideration his mother, Lois (Jane Kaczmarek), spends it all on a fancy dollhouse. 9 P.M. (Discovery) EGYPT UNTOLD: THE CURSE OF KING TUT -- Tutankhamen died young. Howard Carter (portrayed by Stuart Graham, right) found his tomb in 1922. Carter's sponsor, Lord Carnarvon, died shortly thereafter. Some believe he was a victim of the boy pharaoh's revenge. 10 P.M. (CMT) THE 20 GREATEST PBR MOMENTS -- That stands for professional bull riding. ANITA GATES

VThe Supreme Court agreed on Friday to try to define, more precisely than in the past, the emergencies that can justify a warrantless police entry into a private home. The case is an appeal filed by the State of Utah from a Utah Supreme Court decision early last year that four Brigham City police officers violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure by entering a home to break up a fight.

VQuarterback Marcus Vick brought name recognition and some success to the Virginia Tech football program. But he may be remembered most for the embarrassment he caused the university in a tumultuous tenure. Vick, the younger brother of Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick, a former Hokies star, was dismissed from the team yesterday after a string of legal troubles off the field and poor sportsmanship on it. He had been suspended from the program once before, but he will not get another chance.

VI can't say that ''Grandma's Boy'' is exactly a good movie, and given that 20th Century Fox did not bother to show it to critics before it opened yesterday, I doubt that the folks at the studio would disagree. Nor, however, can I deny that along with at least some of the half-dozen other reviewers attending a ''courtesy screening'' yesterday morning, I did manage to be more tickled than annoyed at some of the movie's dumb, crude attempts at humor. Perhaps it was a contact high from the prodigious quantities of marijuana consumed on screen, but this vulgar stoner comedy about an underachieving, over-age video-game tester did make me laugh more than once. Produced and written (with Barry Wernick and Nick Swardson) by Allen Covert, who also stars, ''Grandma's Boy'' has a perverse kind of integrity. Its characters -- in particular, Alex, the X-box-addicted, reefer-mad couch potato played by Mr. Covert -- do not apologize for their immature, irresponsible ways, and the film does not force them to grow up or to learn any valuable lessons. Instead, it cheerfully invites the audience to descend to their level, where no joke is too silly or raunchy, and a plot is just a way of passing time between game levels and bong hits.

VAS far as Kyle Stoneman is concerned, the campus police were the ones who started the Facebook wars. ''We were just being, well, college students, and they used it against us,'' says Mr. Stoneman, a senior at George Washington University in Washington. He is convinced that the campus security force got wind of a party he and some buddies were planning last year by monitoring Facebook.com, the phenomenally popular college networking site. The officers waited till the shindig was in full swing, Mr. Stoneman grouses, then shut it down on discovering under-age drinking. Mr. Stoneman and his friends decided to fight back. Their weapon of choice? Facebook, of course.

VA federal appeals court has upheld a 55-year prison term imposed on a Utah man with no criminal record who was convicted in 2003 of selling several hundred dollars worth of marijuana on three occasions. The case of the man, Weldon H. Angelos, a record producer from Salt Lake City who was 22 at the time of his crime, has become a benchmark in the debate about sentencing rules and justice. The trial judge in the case complained in issuing the sentence, which was required by federal statutes, that he thought it excessive, and 29 former judges and prosecutors agreed, in a brief filed on Mr. Angelos's behalf.

VONE of the few advertisers that bought commercial time during the premiere last week of ''The Book of Daniel'' on NBC will not be back. The series, about a priest, was singled out before its debut by a conservative activist organization, the American Family Association, which condemned it as anti-Christian. The advertiser is Combe Inc., a company in White Plains that sells personal care products, which bought a 30-second commercial for Just for Men hair coloring. It was one of only about two dozen national spots that ran during the two-hour back-to-back episodes that composed the premiere of ''The Book of Daniel'' from 9 to 11 p.m. (Eastern and Pacific times) last Friday.

VA. J. Weberman stood near Bleecker and Elizabeth Streets recently, telling the story of how Bob Dylan got mad at him. It was the spring of 1972, according to Mr. Weberman, when Mr. Dylan grabbed him and shoved him angrily before riding off on a bicycle. For years, Mr. Weberman had been rooting around in Mr. Dylan's trash, looking for insight into the songwriter's sometimes oblique lyrics. He had promised to stop the snooping, but had been visiting the trash cans again, he said, incurring Mr. Dylan's displeasure.

VThe year 2005 was a very good one for the hitmaking producer Scott Storch. For dozens of weeks, singles like Mario's ''Let Me Love You,'' 50 Cent's ''Candy Shop'' and ''Just a Lil Bit'' and Lil' Kim's ''Lighters Up'' -- all of which he helped create -- topped the Billboard charts and blasted from radio stations around the country. And he is the man behind ''Run It,'' the ubiquitous ditty that single-handedly kick-started the career of the R&B singer Chris Brown. But as Mr. Storch, 32, strolled about a Louis Vuitton store in Miami one recent December afternoon, buying everything his well-paid heart desired, he looked anything but happy when talk shifted from $300 sneakers to awards. He, it turns out, was outraged and ''shocked'' that he did not receive a Grammy nomination for producer of the year alongside the likes of Danger Mouse, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and the Neptunes.

VTwo new approaches to weight loss are up for review by federal regulators. And they represent vastly different solutions to the nation's obesity epidemic -- for consumers and for the companies behind the drugs. One, called Acomplia, would be a prescription pill to control appetite by blocking the same brain receptors that stimulate the ''munchies'' in marijuana smokers. Some financial analysts see Acomplia as the most promising new drug of the year, and they predict multibillion-dollar sales eventually for its maker, the French company Sanofi-Aventis.

VNick Cassavetes is loath to label his new movie -- ''Alpha Dog,'' about a group of suburban, teenage gangster wannabes who corner themselves into committing cold-blooded murder -- a mere cautionary tale about wayward youth and missing-in-action parents. At the very least, though, it's a cautionary tale for writer-directors thinking of tackling a breaking news story as their next subject.

VThe Supreme Court removed an obstacle on Tuesday to state efforts to authorize physician-assisted suicide, ruling 6 to 3 that John Ashcroft, the former attorney general, acted without legal authority when he threw the federal government's weight against the Death With Dignity Act in Oregon five years ago. With the new chief justice, John G. Roberts Jr., in dissent in the most high-profile case since he joined the court, the decision lifted a major barrier to state initiatives like the one in Oregon, which has the only assisted-suicide law in the country.

VA sharp increase in the number of people arriving in emergency rooms with methamphetamine-related problems is straining local hospital budgets and treatment facilities across the country, particularly in the Midwest, according to two surveys to be released in Washington today. The studies, conducted late last year by the National Association of Counties, are another indicator of the toll the drug has taken on local communities, particularly in rural areas where social service networks are ill-equipped to deal with the consequences. In July, the association reported that an overwhelming number of sheriffs polled nationwide declared methamphetamine their No. 1 law enforcement problem.

VThe chief executive of a reggae music production company has been convicted of smuggling more than a ton of marijuana a week from California to New York over the past eight years, federal prosecutors said. The executive, Horatio Hamilton, president of Lords of Yard Inc., was convicted of conspiracy to traffic in marijuana, Michael J. Garcia, the United States attorney, said yesterday in a written statement. Mr. Garcia said Mr. Hamilton jumped bail after he was arrested in 1999 with nearly two tons of marijuana in Los Angeles. He later became a prominent music producer and creator of Sashi, a three-day reggae concert in Jamaica. Mr. Hamilton, who was rearrested last year, faces a mandatory sentence of 20 years in federal prison, prosecutors said.

VThreat Leads Museum to Hide Klimt Art A threat to destroy five Gustav Klimt masterpieces valued at nearly $250 million prompted an Austrian museum to remove them from view yesterday, Agence France-Press reported. The paintings, dispatched to safety by the Belvedere Gallery in Vienna, were under a recent court order to be returned to Maria Altmann, the 89-year-old Californian who is the niece and heir of Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, an Austrian industrialist whose possessions were expropriated by the Nazis. The museum said Mrs. Altmann's American lawyer, E. Randol Schoenberg, received the threat by e-mail and added that in safeguarding the two portraits and three landscapes, regarded as jewels of the Austrian public collections, it was acting on recommendations from the Austrian Interior Ministry and an insurance company. Mr. Schoenberg said on Wednesday that Austria, without a right of pre-emption, had negotiated an option to buy back some or all of the paintings by May. Making Music and Money U2, below, with revenues totaling $255,022,633.35, stands atop Billboard's inaugural Money Makers chart, a list of the 20 acts that generated the most income in 2005. The sum is derived from all album and digital sales and box-office receipts for the 11 months from the first Nielsen SoundScan sales week of 2005, which ended on Jan. 9, through the week of Dec. 4. U2 ranked 27th in album sales, ninth in digital sales and first at the box office. On the chart, released yesterday, the Rolling Stones finished a distant second, with $152.3 million; Kenny Chesney third, with $87.7 million; Sir Paul McCartney fourth, with $84.2 million; and Sir Elton John fifth, with $77.1 million. J. D. Salinger Slept Here Some aspiring writer will get to live in the old dorm room of J. D. Salinger, left, at Ursinus College in Collegeville, Pa., as the recipient of a $25,000 annual scholarship developed by Jon Volkmer and Matthew Kozusko, two professors of English, The Associated Press reported. What's more, the scholarship, intended for creative writers, won't necessarily go to someone with towering grades. In a statement, Professor Volkmer said: ''As many great writers, including Salinger, have shown, the best writers are often not the best students. In the spirit of Holden Caulfield, we're looking to help out the quirky kid with unique vision. This is not just another award for the high SAT crowd.'' Ursinus officials said the reclusive Mr. Salinger, the author of ''The Catcher in the Rye,'' had not commented on the scholarship. He studied at Ursinus, a liberal arts college, in the fall of 1938. Punishment and Crime Remember the fellow who was arrested in June for stealing and trying to sell advance copies of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''? His name was Aaron Lambert. He was a 20-year-old security guard at a distribution center for the eagerly awaited J. K. Rowling novel, The Guardian of London reported. And, oh yes, he was also accused of shooting a blank pistol at a journalist when he failed to make the sale. Mr. Lambert, who admitted trying to blackmail the publisher, Bloomsbury, by revealing the contents of the book, has been sentenced to 12 months for theft, 18 months for a firearms offense and two years for blackmail. Pete Doherty, below, the trouble-prone British singer, pleaded guilty yesterday in a London court to charges of heroin, crack cocaine, morphine and marijuana possession stemming from an arrest on Dec. 4. Mr. Doherty, 26, was also arrested on Nov. 30 and charged with possession of heroin and cocaine. He pleaded guilty last week and was released on bail. He was arrested again last Saturday on suspicion of possessing drugs and released on bail. He is to appear for questioning on Feb. 2. In yesterday's case, he was again freed on bail. He is to be sentenced on Feb. 8.

VSometimes, all it takes is a steady beat to take Mike Anderson back. A marching band may take the field before the game or at halftime. Music fills the air. And Anderson's belly fills with the boom-boom-boom of the drum section, and his heart with the rat-a-tat-tat. ''I'm planning on getting a drum set,'' Anderson, a Broncos running back, said somewhat wistfully. ''It's a lot of noise, a lot of ruckus. I don't think my family will put up with that. But the place we're moving to, I'm going to have my own set and get back to playing.''

VTo the Editor: We should not read too much into the Supreme Court's suggestion, in the assisted-suicide case, that the regulation of medical practice is primarily a matter for the states. All of the justices, on both sides of this decision, acknowledge that Congress could pass a law explicitly forbidding the use of drugs in physician-assisted suicide. And this has important implications for abortion.

VIn the seven months since Iowa passed a law restricting the sale of cold medicines used to make methamphetamine, seizures of homemade methamphetamine laboratories have dropped to just 20 a month from 120. People once terrified about the neighbor's house blowing up now walk up to the state's drug policy director, Marvin Van Haaften, at his local Wal-Mart to thank him for making them safer. But Mr. Van Haaften, like officials in other states with similar restrictions, is now worried about a new problem: the drop in home-cooked methamphetamine has been met by a new flood of crystal methamphetamine coming largely from Mexico.

VMen in uniforms like those worn by the Mexican military crossed the Rio Grande into the United States on Monday on a marijuana-smuggling foray, leading to an armed confrontation with Texas law officers, the authorities said. No shots were fired. The men retreated and escaped back across the border with much of the marijuana, though they abandoned more than a half-ton as they fled and set fire to one of their vehicles, the authorities said. The Mexican government said its military was not involved. Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, ordered an investigation into the incident, which occurred near Neely's Crossing about 50 miles southeast of El Paso.

VThe United States demanded that Mexico fully investigate how and why men dressed in Mexican military uniforms crossed the Rio Grande on Monday and ended up in an armed standoff with Texas law enforcement officers. The men, who appeared to be Mexican soldiers, helped marijuana smugglers who were being chased by the police escape back across the river into Mexico about 50 miles east of El Paso. A spokesman for Mexico's president, Vicente Fox, denied Mexican soldiers were involved, suggesting that the men were drug dealers in stolen uniforms. The Mexican military, meanwhile, issued an order that all its units stay out of a mile-wide zone along the border. JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. (NYT)

VDrug smugglers have dug one of the longest, most sophisticated tunnels discovered in recent years along the Mexican border, and the American and Mexican authorities have hauled nearly two tons of marijuana out of it since they entered it on Wednesday, officials said. The tunnel is 60 feet below ground at some points, five feet high, and nearly half a mile long, extending from a warehouse near the international airport in Tijuana, Mexico, to a vacant industrial building in Otay Mesa, Calif., about 20 miles southeast of downtown San Diego. The sophistication of the tunnel surprised officials, who found it outfitted with a concrete floor, electricity, lights and ventilation and groundwater pumping systems.

VINTERNATIONAL A3-11 Hamas a Surprise Winner In Palestinian Elections The radical Islamic party Hamas scored an overwhelming and unexpected victory in Palestinian legislative elections, taking 76 out of the 132 seats, deposing the former ruling Fatah party, which won only 43 seats. The results give Hamas the right to form the next government, ending more than 40 years of domination by Fatah. A1 Hamas's victory threw President Bush and his aides on the defensive, complicating the administration's policy of trying to promote democracy as an antidote to the spread of terrorism in the Arab world. Mr. Bush said the results spoke to the failures of the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, to root out corruption, not to any flaws in the Bush administration's policy. A11 The elections were met with a mixture of jubilation and consternation in much of the Arab world, and for some it raised the concern that, in winning, Hamas would almost certainly have to change. A11 European leaders, whose countries are major financial donors to the Palestinian Authority, registered disquiet verging on hostility toward Hamas's triumph. A11 Strife at World Economic Forum A magazine article calling on nations to boycott Israel because of its treatment of Palestinians has provoked a tempest at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting, prompting the organizers to pull the magazine from its shelves and issue an apology. A11 U.S. and China Back Plan for Iran President Bush and the Chinese government both declared their full support for a Russian proposal to allow Iran to run civilian nuclear facilities as long as Russia and international nuclear inspectors are in full control of the fuel. A3 Unmet Pledges to Rebuild Iraq Because of unforeseen security costs, haphazard planning and shifting priorities, the American-financed reconstruction program in Iraq will not complete scores of projects that were promised to help rebuild the country, a federal oversight agency reported. A8 The American military said it had released five Iraqi women, half those held in its prisons, but said the release had been previously scheduled and was unrelated to demands made by the kidnappers of the American journalist Jill Carroll. A8 More Energy Woes for Georgia Energy shortages struck Georgia anew as a wind storm toppled a major power transmission line and Russia's gas monopoly failed to restore the flow of natural gas to the country after pipelines were sabotaged last weekend, energy officials said. A4 Groups Protest U.N. Proposal Human rights organizations and the Congressional Human Rights Caucus protested a decision by the United States to back a measure introduced by Iran denying two international gay rights groups a voice at the United Nations. A4 NATIONAL A14-21 Poll Finds Mixed Support For Domestic Spy Program Americans are willing to tolerate eavesdropping without warrants to fight terrorism, but are concerned that the aggressive antiterrorism programs championed by the Bush administration are encroaching on civil liberties, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll. A1 President Bush declared again that his administration's program for eavesdropping without warrants was well within existing law, and said efforts in Congress to write legislation expressly giving him authority for such a program were unnecessary and dangerous. A20 Lobbyist Inquiry Takes a Turn The investigation into Jack Abramoff, the disgraced Republican lobbyist, took a new turn when the Justice Department said the chief prosecutor in the inquiry would step down next week because he had been nominated to a federal judgeship by President Bush. A21 Kerry Calls for Filibuster Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, left, called for a filibuster of the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr. More than 60 senators have already vowed to support him, and the leaders of both parties said they expected to hold the full vote on Tuesday. A14 Officials Discover Drug Tunnel Drug smugglers have dug one of the longest, most sophisticated tunnels discovered in recent years along the Mexican border, and the American and Mexican authorities have hauled nearly two tons of marijuana out of it since it was found, officials said. A14 NEW YORK/REGION B1-8 Bloomberg Wants to Speed Rebuilding at Ground Zero Mayor Bloomberg used his State of the City speech to call for a drastic change in the World Trade Center development plan so the project can finally move forward. A1 Children Displaced Hundreds of New York City children who had been in contact with child welfare workers have been placed in foster care or under court supervision since the death of 7-year-old Nixzmary Brown.

A1 BUSINESS DAY C1-14 Banks and Health Care Banks, credit unions and money management firms are positioning themselves to become central players in the business of health care in anticipation of health savings accounts, which are the centerpiece of President George W. Bush's plans on health care. A1 Boston Scientific Warned A day after winning a $27 billion takeover battle for the medical device maker Guidant, Boston Scientific received a broad warning from federal health regulators that is likely to temporarily prevent the company from introducing new products and could result in a fine. C1 Profits Rise at Microsoft Microsoft said its quarterly profit rose 5 percent, roughly matching Wall Street's forecasts, as the high cost of launching the Xbox 360 game console was offset by strong sales of servers and software tools.

VJosh Marshall of Talking Points Memo tries to figure out why photos of President Bush with Jack Abramoff were deleted from an online photo database. The Wall Street Journal's Daniel Henninger blames Congressional reform efforts from the 70's and two laws in particular - one that limited campaign contributions and one that changed the budget process - for inexorably leading to the Abramoff scandal. Colby Cosh, a columnist for Canada's National Post, writes in the Los Angeles Times about the other earthquake of an election this week: "The new regime is likely to end the recent drift toward decriminalization of soft drugs, so visitors will still have to consume marijuana with discretion. On the other hand, Liberal proposals to apply special taxes on junk food are also dead. For frequent pot users, it sounds like a wash."

VThe name Broken Social Scene evidences a smart sense of indie-rock branding. It suggests three things: chaos, community and nostalgia for a bygone heyday of tight-knit underground music scenes. Though its arena-rock swell mostly inclines toward the anthemic sound of its fellow Canadians Arcade Fire or even U2, this Toronto collective's psychedelia, obscured pop melodies, bright guitar noodling, feedback swirl and cryptic lyrical aphorisms also make plain its allegiance to quirkier bands like Pavement and Yo La Tengo. One thing setting the group apart is its desire to bring an everyday candor to the aloof arena-rock milieu.

VA Virginia man arrested in a national investigation of child pornography on the Internet pleaded guilty to multiple charges involving the sexual exploitation of boys and the operation of illegal Web sites, the Justice Department said Friday. The man, Gregory J. Mitchel, 38, was an administrator of several illegal Web sites and admitted in his plea to producing and distributing child pornography through the Internet. In that role, the Justice Department said, Mr. Mitchel filmed boys engaging in sex acts and received money from Web site subscribers who paid monthly fees for viewing live and recorded videos.

VIn last summer's prize-winning R-rated film ''Me and You and Everyone We Know,'' a barely pubescent boy is seduced into oral sex by two girls perhaps a year older, and his 6-year-old brother logs on to a pornographic chat room and solicits a grown woman with instant messages about ''poop.'' Is this what your teenage children are watching? If so, what message are they getting about sexual mores, and what effect will it have on their behavior?

VIT was around 1:30 on an afternoon last November, prosecutors say, when Jeffery Romano, a councilman from Tenafly, pulled his 2006 Chevrolet Corvette up to the Joseph P. Bradley Court housing complex, a notorious collection of 20 dreary, low-slung brown brick buildings on the outskirts of Newark. Mr. Romano had a passenger with him by the name of Jerome Yelletts, a 47-year-old man from Orange who lived with his parents and had a record for assault and criminal mischief. Mr. Yelletts got out of the Corvette and walked into a building. He emerged a few minutes later and got back in the car. Mr. Romano pulled away.

Win drove to Lamont's house, planning to tell her that he quit, but when he arrived, he found her in her bedroom, tied to the bedpost, with an armed man hovering over her. In a struggle, Win shot the attacker. Now Lamont and Win are in the hospital, where she and her assailant were taken.

VRobert A. Durst, the real estate scion acquitted of murder in Texas despite admitting that he carved up his 71-year-old neighbor, cut the last ties to his family and 10 Manhattan skyscrapers on Monday in return for a payout of about $65 million. Mr. Durst, long estranged from his family, agreed in Westchester County Surrogate's Court to settle a lawsuit he had brought against the Durst family trusts and the trustees: his younger brother Douglas; a cousin, Jonathan; and a lawyer, Richard Siegler. The value of the settlement was described in court as ''blank,'' but people on both sides of the dispute said Mr. Durst would get more than $60 million.

VA 41-year-old Long Island man was arrested and charged with kidnapping and sexually abusing a 24-year-old woman on Monday morning, the police said. The man, Richard Padilla of Huntington Station, is accused of forcing the woman into a car at gunpoint at Second Avenue and East 12th Street about 6 a.m. Mr. Padilla then sexually assaulted her, the police said. Police officers on patrol said they stopped the car in Harlem after they saw Mr. Padilla commit a traffic violation. The officers had the woman step out of the car, and she told them that she had been abducted and sexually assaulted, the police said. The woman was taken to a hospital in stable condition. Mr. Padilla was also charged with committing a criminal sexual act and criminal possession of marijuana. JENNIFER 8. LEE (NYT)

VThe protesters here certainly know what they don't like: war, globalization, capitalism, drug laws, immigrant detention centers, a high-speed train line and, inexplicably, the Olympic torch. ''This is a discussion of war,'' said Claudio Robba, 25, one of maybe 150 protesters at a piazza, referring, in fact, to a well-designed stick with a little flame on top.

VSelective listings by critics of The New York Times of new and noteworthy cultural events in the New York metropolitan region this week. * denotes a highly recommended film, concert, show or exhibition.

The Tony winner Phylicia Rashad (''A Raisin in the Sun'') plays another formidable matriarchal figure with an iron will in Lincoln Center's musical version of Lorca's '' House of Bernarda Alba.'' Michael John LaChiusa, who already has one musical to his name this season, ''See What I Wanna See,'' contributes music and lyrics (1:30). Mitzi Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street; (212) 239-6200. 'DEFIANCE' Opens Feb. 28. Set on a Marine Corps base during the 1970's, John Patrick Shanley's new play, his first since ''Doubt,'' revolves around an explosive incident between an African-American marine and a white one.

Maybe the biggest question mark of the musical season, this intriguing show is an adaptation of the cult documentary about the eccentric socialite relatives of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (2:30). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. 'INDOOR/OUTDOOR' Opens Feb. 22. The playwright Kenny Finkle aims for the cat lover demographic in this relationship comedy about a computer programmer and his chatty feline companion (1:50). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200. 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Opens Feb. 27.

Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 315-0231. '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Previews start Wednesday. Opens Feb. 26. This New York Musical Theater Festival hit is a satirical musical about several artists racing to finish a musical in three weeks. Apparently, they got it done (1:30).

MCC Theater presents Glen Berger's gothic fairy tale set in the fictitious Scottish town of Brood (2:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village; (212) 279-4200. Broadway * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show written and performed by Sarah Jones is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200.(Charles Isherwood) 'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring Jonathan Pryce and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punchline. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Beginning Tuesday, Judy Kuhn replaces Maria Friedman. Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER' A crisp outline of the Pulitzer Prizewinner Nilo Cruz's new play suggests the crazy-quilt melodramas of early Almodóvar: Father and daughter are attracted to the same sexy bad boy, igniting all manner of emotional fireworks. But Mr. Cruz's reflective, unhurried pace and his meandering, lyrical dialogue allow his fuses to burn a little too long, resulting in more fizzle than flash (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) 'CONFESSIONS OF A MORMON BOY' Steven Fales, a sixth-generation Mormon, describes leaving his family and becoming a gay escort in this fairly conventional, although admittedly compelling, piece of confessional theater (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street; (212) 691-1555. (Jason Zinoman) 'DECEMBER FOOLS' Sherman Yellen takes a stab at the letters-in-a-drawer play (old letters are discovered, and lives are changed), and things get off to a promising start: a New York matron's disgruntled daughter finds some of Mom's old screeds and turns them into weapons. But the play is too long, and some dandy comedy is undercut by some tired melodrama (2:15). Abington Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger) 'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) * 'LENNY BRUCE IN HIS OWN WORDS' Jason Fisher does an impressive facsimile of this legendary comic in a nostalgic greatest-hits collection of his stand-up routines (1:10). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the arch-manipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) * 'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION' An absolutely splendid Dana Ivey takes the title role in Charlotte Moore's sensitively acted production of Bernard Shaw's famously provocative play, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary on the New York stage this year (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood) 'RFK' This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb) * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway AVALON' Glory Sims Bowen's retelling of the Camelot legend from the women's point of view is entertaining but too long and uncertain in tone. The comic moments work better than the earnest ones (2:20). Looking Glass Theater, 422 West 57th Street, Clinton; (212) 352-3101. (Anita Gates) 'A BITTER TASTE' When an academic gets too close to one of his case studies, his mistake haunts him in this twisty, acid drama about repression, friendship and the intersection between sex and power (2:00). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton; (212) 352-3101. (Zinoman) 'ELLIOT, A SOLDIER'S FUGUE' True to its title, ''Elliot, a Soldier's Fugue'' is composed like a fugue, with several narrative strands playing in point and counterpoint around one theme: a soldier's experience of war. The play, by Quiara Alegria Hudes, traces the legacy of war through three generations of a Puerto Rican family, and without invoking current politics, manages to indict the war in Iraq (1:10). 45 Below at the Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 352-3101. (Phoebe Hoban) 'GIRL IN HEAT' Nelson Avidon's predictable dramedy about Joseph, a randy lawyer, and Marilyn, a flirtatious office temp, is salvaged to some extent by the play's two performers. As their characters reveal themselves uneasily, Mr. Avidon and Cheryl Leibert make the struggle believable (1:20). Michael Weller Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 352-3101. (Andrea Stevens) 'LENNY & LOU' This black comedy by Ian Cohen about two brothers and their foul-mouthed, demented mother has the right ingredients for shock theater: four-letter words, sex talk, sex acts. But it somehow doesn't shock (2:15). 29th Street Rep, 212 West 29th Street, Chelsea; (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) * 'MAJOR BANG OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE DIRTY BOMB' This disarming exercise in political cabaret demonstrates that laughter in the dark need not be desperate. Written by Kirk Lynn, this multilevel, multiform tale of nuclear anxiety resurrects the sane, inquisitive satiric spirit of the early 1960's, a time when irony was a strategic tool instead of a conditioned reflex. Paul Lazar directs Steve Cuiffo and Maggie Hoffman in a multitude of roles (1:10). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn; (718) 254-8779. (Brantley) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton; (212) 868-4444. (Hoban) * 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village; (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200.

Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'ALMOST, MAINE' John Cariani's comedy comprises almost a dozen two-character vignettes exploring the sudden thunderclap of love and the scorched earth that sometimes follows. It will evoke either ''awww's'' or ''ick's,'' depending on your affection for its whimsical approach to the joys and perils of romance (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Isherwood) * 'APARTMENT 3A' Jeff Daniels's romance about a woman who lost her faith is written with wit, conviction and a real affection for its characters (1:30). Arclight Theater, 152 West 71st Street; (212) 352-0255; closing tomorrow. (Zinoman) 'BURIED CHILD' Sam Shepard's dark and sometimes funny portrait of a dysfunctional Midwestern family doesn't translate successfully into the bright colors of Norman Rockwell Americana. The director, Cyndy A. Marion, and her White Horse Theater Company did much better a year ago with a production of another Shepard play about family, ''The Late Henry Moss,'' which was full of mystery and emotion (2:40). The American Theater of Actors, Sargent Theater, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton; (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. (Stevens) 'FUNNYHOUSE OF A NEGRO' Adrienne Kennedy's one-act nightmare from 1964, about a young black woman obsessed with whiteness, is still innovative theater, but it also plays as a period piece, making it doubly interesting (50 minutes). Harlem School of the Arts, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, Hamilton Heights; (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'HECUBA' At an intermissionless 90 minutes, this rendition of Euripides' tragedy is fairly painless -- though that's not necessarily a good thing (1:30). Pearl Theater Company, at Theater 80, 80 St. Mark's Place, East Village; (212) 598-9802; closing Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'SAFETY' A cynical, contrived portrayal of the life of a war photographer that attacks its subject with a heavy hand (1:25). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street; (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. (Zinoman) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'ANNAPOLIS' (PG-13, 108 minutes) ''Annapolis'' is so gung-ho about the United States Naval Academy's ability to turn boys into fighting men and rebels into scrappy team players that it could easily be confused with a military recruiting film. (Stephen Holden) 'BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE 2' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Martin Lawrence is back in fat-lady drag in this inconsequential sequel for undemanding moviegoers. Mr. Lawrence makes the most of the incongruity of a manly F.B.I. agent posing as a nanny in floral-print dresses, but the humor doesn't go much beyond oversize underwear and a tequila-drinking dog. (Anita Gates) * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden) * 'BUBBLE' (R, 72 minutes) A rigorously minimalist story about three factory workers, all played by nonprofessionals, whose placid existence is shattered after two in the little group become romantically linked. Violence liberates the three from the bubble of their existence, much as creative experimentation has periodically liberated the movie's director, Steven Soderbergh, from the prison of commercial mainstream filmmaking. (Manohla Dargis) * 'CACHÉ (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott) * 'CASANOVA' (R, 110 minutes) Heath Ledger affirms his status as the pansexual art-house heartthrob of the moment in this high-spirited farce suggested by the career of 18th-century Venice's most notorious seducer. Silly, sly and delightful. (Scott) 'COWBOY DEL AMOR' (No rating, 86 minutes, in English and Spanish) For 16 years, Ivan Thompson, a self-styled 'Cowboy Cupid,' has been supporting himself by helping disenchanted American men meet hopeful Mexican women. Directed by Michèle Ohayon with an attentive ear for the regressive attitudes beneath the humor, ''Cowboy Del Amor'' is a slyly insightful portrait of conflicting expectations in the search for the perfect partner. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'END OF THE SPEAR' (PG-13, 112 minutes) This fact-based story of conflict and resolution between a primitive warrior tribe in Ecuador and North American missionaries in the mid-1950's is inspiring enough to make you wish that the sentimental excesses of this Kiplingesque tale had been reined in. (Holden) 'FINAL DESTINATION 3' (R, 92 minutes) It's more dead teenagers and lunatic determinism in this grim third installment of the enjoyably preposterous ''Final Destination'' franchise. (Nathan Lee) 'GLORY ROAD' (PG, 109 minutes) The true story, more or less, of the 1966 Texas Western College basketball team -- the first all-black starting five to play in an N.C.A.A. final. By the numbers, but inspiring all the same. (Scott) 'A GOOD WOMAN' (R, 93 minutes) This loose adaptation of Oscar Wilde's 1892 comedy, ''Lady Windermere's Fan,'' moves it out of the drawing room, and out of England to the Italian Riviera in 1930, casting as its leads two American actors (Helen Hunt and Scarlett Johansson) who have no feel for Wilde's high-toned repartee: fatal mistakes all. (Holden) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott) * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis) 'HOODWINKED' (PG, 81 minutes) Little Red Riding Hood is deconstructed in this sub-''Shrek'' bummer, the latest collaboration between computers and cynicism. (Lee) 'HOSTEL' (R, 95 minutes) Two ugly Americans rampage through Europe before finding themselves ensnared in an underground Slovakian snuff club. The calculated outrages of this brutal exploitation film prove less shocking than its relentless bigotry. (Lee) 'IMAGINE ME & YOU' (R, 93 minutes) A bland romance from the British writer and director Ol Parker about a woman (Piper Perabo) who's fast-tracking down the straight and narrow when the florist-next-door (Lena Headey) throws up a roadblock. (Dargis) * 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott) 'THE LAST HOLIDAY' (PG-13, 112 minutes) Based on a 1950 British film, Wayne Wang's comedy about a gentle soul who learns to live only after learning of her imminent death is one of those generic wish-fulfillment flicks in which the soul in question actualizes her goals through perseverance and pluck. The star Queen Latifah charms, but even she can't gold-plate junk. (Dargis) * 'MANDERLAY' (R, 138 minutes) To warm to ''Manderlay,'' the chilly second installment of the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier's yet-to-be-completed three-part Brechtian allegory examining American history, you must be willing to tolerate the derision and moral arrogance of a snide European intellectual thumbing his nose at American barbarism. Those willing to endure his scorn are in for a bracing satire of the legacy of slavery in the United States. (Holden) * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott) 'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden) 'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis) * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis) 'NANNY McPHEE' (PG, 99 minutes) In the endearing but somewhat scatterbrained British film ''Nanny McPhee,'' Emma Thompson creates an indelible character reminiscent of the pre-Disney Mary Poppins working benign magic to shape up an unruly brood of children. (Holden) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) 'ROVING MARS' (G, 40 minutes) Mars. IMAX. If you want to grow up to be an astronaut, prepare to bliss out. (Lee) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'TAMARA' (R, 98 minutes) Low in budget as well as ambition, this ''Carrie'' knockoff is a movie of few innovations but one genuine surprise: the inability of the title character, an evil sorceress, to manage in high heels. (Lee) 'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott) * 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott) 'THROUGH THE FIRE' (No rating, 103 minutes) Jonathan Hock's unwaveringly upbeat documentary follows the basketball sensation Sebastian Telfair, a senior at Lincoln High School in Coney Island, as he chooses between the University of Louisville and the N.B.A. Yet behind the cheering and popping flashbulbs lurks another, much darker movie, one that questions the relationship between sneaker manufacturers and financially deprived kids with exceptional talent. (Catsoulis) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) 'UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION' (R, 106 minutes) In this sequel to ''Underworld'' (2003), the writer and director Len Wiseman and the writer Danny McBride pick up the story of the vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and the vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) as they race to prevent the release of an imprisoned über-werewolf. With leads who strain to manage one facial expression between them, and a cinematographer who shoots everything through the same steel-blue filter, ''Underworld: Evolution'' is little more than a monotonous barrage of computer-generated fur and fangs. (Catsoulis) 'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden) Film Series ANOTHER SPANISH CINEMA: FILM IN CATALUNYA 1906-2006 (Through Tuesday) The Film Society of Lincoln Center's retrospective of Catalán film continues this weekend with screenings including Pere Portabella's ''Warsaw Bridge'' (1989), three parallel stories set all over Barcelona; Agusti Villaronga's ''In a Glass Cage'' (1987), a drama about depravity that the American director John Waters has said he found shocking; and ''Fausto 5.0'' (2001), the Catalán theater group La Fura dels Baus's interpretation of Goethe's ''Faust.''

(Gates) FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Through Sunday) This year the theme of the Museum of the Moving Image and the New York Film Critics Circle's series is the experience of being a stranger in a strange land. The series ends this weekend with five films, including Stephen Frears's 1985 comic drama, ''My Beautiful Laundrette,'' selected by Gene Seymour, about two young men who go into business together and fall in love; and Roko Belic's ''Genghis Blues'' (1999), selected by Lisa Schwarzbaum, a documentary about a blind American blues musician who teaches himself throat-singing. 36-01 35th Avenue, at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10.

(Jon Pareles) BISHOP ALLEN (Tonight) The indie pop outfit Bishop Allen is in the spotlight lately for its frontman Justin Rice's leading-man turn in Andrew Bujalski's film ''Mutual Appreciation.'' In it he plays to a receptive but sparse Brooklyn crowd. His own band has a slightly larger following. 9:30 p.m., Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, at Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 420-1466; $8. (Laura Sinagra) LAURA CANTRELL (Tonight) This singer, guitarist and songwriter has a deep alt-country résumé that includes an old-timey country radio show on WFMU (91.1 FM) and real Southern roots.

This bill also includes Hong Kong and Baby Shakes. 9 p.m., Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 475-7088; $10. (Sinagra) ELECTRIC SIX, SHE WANTS REVENGE (Tomorrow, Sunday and Monday) The Detroit garage rockers Electric Six broke out of the pack by virtue of the singer Dick Valentine's mania on songs like ''Danger! High Voltage.'' The band's new album, ''Senor Smoke,'' is less compelling, but features the timely apocalyptic rumination ''Jimmy Carter.''

(Sinagra) TOM JONES (Tuesday and Wednesday) The newly knighted Welsh pop singer Sir Tom Jones learned a lot from American blues and soul, and he seems as amused as anyone by his long-established image as a sex symbol.

He is one of reggae's most important producers, using the studio to fill arrangements with distortion, ghostly echoes and disorienting silences.

King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $25 in advance, $30 at the door.

(Pareles) BEN TAYLOR , TRISTAN PRETTYMAN (Wednesday) Ben Taylor joined his mother, Carly Simon, onstage this fall, performing, among other things, his father James Taylor's part on the duet ''Mockingbird.''

(Sinagra) VERONICAS (Tuesday) The twin rockers Lisa and Jess Origiassio, from Brisbane, Australia, perform focus-group-tested radio pop in the Kelly Clarkson vein.

(Sinagra) WU-TANG CLAN (Tuesday) Before there was G-Unit or the Diplomats, there was the Wu Tang Clan. This Staten Island crew created a secret code that mixed Kung-fu arcana and Five-Percenter cosmology. Its most deliciously unpredictable member, Old Dirty Bastard, is gone, but the group has reconvened for its first tour since 2004, boasting the talents of the thug-turned-comedian Method Man; the master atmospheric producer RZA; the eloquent GZA and Raekwon; and the excitable absurdist Ghostface Killah. 6:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-7740; $44.

(Kozinn) DAME FELICITY LOTT (Monday) This veteran British soprano should make much of ''Fallen Women and Virtuous Wives,'' the title of a themed recital with songs by everyone from Haydn and Mozart to Kurt Weill and Noël Coward, accompanied by her perennial and equally excellent partner Graham Johnson. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $40 to $48. (Midgette) MUSIC FROM JAPAN (Tomorrow and Sunday) A two-day festival presents traditional and contemporary music for the shakuhachi tomorrow, with Akikazu Nakamura as the soloist and Michiyo Yagi playing the 20-string koto, and a showcase of young Japanese composers on Sunday.

(Midgette) NEW YORK COLLEGIUM (Tonight) French baroque is the theme of the day: a concert devoted to the music of Louis-Nicolas Clérambault (1676-1749) includes the cantatas ''Orphée'' and ''Pirame et Thisbé.'' Robert Mealy will lead the group and play violin; Marc Molomot is the vocal soloist. 8, Society for Ethical Culture, Central Park West at 64th Street, (212) 717-9246; $30 to $50. (Midgette) NEW YORK FESTIVAL OF SONG (Tuesday and Wednesday) For Valentine's Day, this concert offers a program about coming together, with a range of ensembles by composers from Schubert to the Beach Boys, called ''All Together Now.'' 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $45. (Midgette) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today, tomorrow and Tuesday) In the final week of its Mozart series, the Philharmonic offers the three last symphonies, Nos. 39, 40 and 41. True, it's about as uninventive as programming can be, but Lorin Maazel has proved a surprising Mozart conductor lately, and during the first two weeks of this minifestival, the Philharmonic players have been at their zestiest. Today at 2 p.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $26 to $94. (Kozinn) PACIFICA QUARTET (Sunday) This young ensemble, based at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana, gave a memorable performance at Alice Tully Hall in 2004, and last year released a solid, richly played traversal of the Mendelssohn string quartets on the Cedille label. It returns for one of Lincoln Center's early morning concerts, with Mendelssohn's Quartet in E flat and Tchaikovsky's Quartet in D. 11 a.m., Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 721-6500; $20. (Kozinn) STAATSKAPELLE BERLIN (Tomorrow and Sunday) Daniel Barenboim reminds New York that he has an orchestra other than the Chicago Symphony. Conducting Germany's oldest orchestra, which he has led for more than a decade, he celebrates this year's birthday boy, Mozart, with two programs, each with two symphonies and a piano concerto in E-flat. Tomorrow's concerto is for two pianos; joining Mr. Barenboim will be Radu Lupu. Tomorrow night at 8, Sunday afternoon at 2, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $38 to $130. (Midgette) ST. LUKE'S CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Tuesday) The Orchestra of St. Luke's may be the most protean group in town. Here its members appear in various chamber combinations for works by Mozart, Debussy, Chopin and Schoenberg. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $28 to $35. (Eichler) 'VOICES OF LIGHT' (Thursday) Richard Einhorn composed this vivid, unusual oratorio as a soundtrack for Carl Theodor Dreyer's silent classic ''The Passion of Joan of Arc,'' a compressed telling of Joan of Arc's trial by an ecclesiastical court and her execution at the stake. His texts draw on the Bible, Joan's letters, the works of Hildegard of Bingen and other medieval churchwomen, and ''The Vices of Women,'' a 13th-century misogynistic ballad; his music pivots between the medieval world and ours. During a screening of the film, it is to be performed live by the Ensemble Sospeso, the New Amsterdam Singers and Anonymous 4, which assembles only for special projects these days. 8 p.m., World Financial Center, West Street, South of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505; free. (Kozinn) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. * RICHARD ALSTON DANCE COMPANY (Tuesday through Feb. 19) The choreographer Richard Alston has been a mainstay of English contemporary dance since the early 1970's, and his musical, often understated work is always worth watching. This program presents three dances new to New York audiences: ''Fever,'' to Monteverdi; ''Such Longing,'' to Chopin's Nocturnes and Études; and ''Gypsy Mixture,'' from the delightfully titled CD ''Electric Gypsyland.'' Tuesday through Feb. 18 at 8 p.m., Feb. 19 at 2 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800 or www.joyce.org; $38. (Roslyn Sulcas) * RONALD K.

(Dunning) * GINA GIBNEY DANCE (Thursday) Ms. Gibney explores the worlds of finite reality and the unknowable, and she has made a third new world of them in her mysterious, subtle ''unbounded.'' (Through Feb. 19.) 8:30 p.m. Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or www.danspaceproject.org; $15. (Dunning) CURT HAWORTH (Tonight through Sunday) ''Descent'' presents a choreographic panorama of 24 hours in a city on the brink of war. 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or www.danspaceproject.org; $15.

Using trapeze, Chinese acrobatics and swing dancing, among other things, the company tackles rock formation, punctuated equilibrium theory and magnetic polarity reversal with its usual strength and verve. (Through Feb. 19.) Tonight and tomorrow night at 7, Sunday at 5 p.m., Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, www.TheaterMania.com; $20 to $25.(Erika Kinetz) HEATHER KRAVAS (Tonight and tomorrow night) What promises to be a lively, internationally flavored double bill, with a three-year, long-distance collaboration between Heather Kravas from New York and Antonija Livingstone from Montreal by way of Berlin, and a duet from PO.V.S., a dance collective from Moscow. 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or www.dtw.org; $12 and $20. (Rockwell) METRO MOVEMENT PROJECT (Tonight and tomorrow night) In ''Modern Dance: Primitive Lights,'' dance by choreographers including Meg Brooker, Claire Elizabeth Barratt, Mark Lamb, Wendy Blum and Vong Phrommala will be presented in four programs, all performed in candlelight in a church setting, to live music and the spoken word. 7 and 9, Metro Baptist Church, 410 West 40th Street, Clinton, (917) 279-1941; $15; $7 for students and 65+. (Dunning) * THE NETA DANCE COMPANY A.W.A.R.D. SHOW (Sunday) This free monthly performance series organized and produced by the choreographer Neta Pulvermacher began in January and runs until May. It's a great idea -- each event presents work by four emerging or midcareer choreographers, then opens up discussion between the artists and the audience. Later everyone has a drink. Melinda Ring, Pele Bauch, Barbara Duffy and the wonderful Keigwin & Company are on the lineup, and Thomas DeFrantz will moderate the discussion. Call first -- the Joyce SoHo had to turn people away last time. 7 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479 or www.joyce.org. (Sulcas) NEW CHAMBER BALLET (Tomorrow) Choreography by Miro Magloire, the company's director, and Deborah Lohse and Constantine Baecher will be performed by dancers including Deborah Wingert. 8 p.m., City Center Studio 4, 130 West 56th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444 or www.smartix.com; $15; $10 for students with ID. and ages 65+ (Dunning) NEW YORK FLAMENCO FESTIVAL 2006 (Tomorrow through Feb. 19) The city's annual celebration of all things Flamenco continues into its second week tomorrow night with the guitarist Vicente Amigo and an ensemble that includes the dancer Rafael Campallo. A gala on Wednesday night lines up some of flamenco's big guns, including the legendary Manolo Marin and Soledad Barrio, often seen in New York with Noche Flamenca. On Thursday, the Nuevo Ballet Español shows flamenco in a more contemporary guise -- a slightly doubtful enterprise -- featuring the wonderful Lola Greco. Various locations; for information: (212) 545-7536 or www.worldmusicinstitute.org/wmical/Main.asp (Sulcas) 92ND STREET Y HARKNESS DANCE FESTIVAL (Tomorrow through Feb. 19) This 12-year-old festival has a noteworthy lineup over its second week. WilliamsWorks, a new troupe directed by a former New York City Ballet dancer, Todd Williams, gives its final performances this weekend (tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.), and the Tel Aviv-based Sally-Anne Friedland Dance Drama Company makes its United States debut. In her world premiere of ''Borders'' and the American premiere of ''Red,'' we are promised that ''the abstraction of dance meets the drama of life'' (Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m.; Feb. 18 at 8 p.m.; Feb. 19 at 2 and 7 p.m.) Ailey Citigroup Theater, Joan Weill Center for Dance, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 415-5500 or www.92Y.org/HarknessFestival; $20; students and 62+, $15. (Sulcas) * STARS OF THE 21ST CENTURY (Monday) Cheesy but usually amusing and sometimes thrilling, these potpourris of dancers from hither and yon, performing to recorded music and offering sometimes challenging choreography but mostly flashy showpieces, are always worth a visit. This year the galaxy, many returning from previous galas, includes Irina Dvorovenko and her husband, Maxim Beloserkovsky, from American Ballet Theater; Sofiane Sylve from the New York City Ballet; Svetlana Lunkina and Sergei Filin from the Bolshoi Ballet; Andrian Fadeyev from the Kirov Ballet; Mathilde Froustey and Emmanuel Thibault from the Paris Opera Ballet; Lucia Lacarra and Cyril Pierre from the Munich Ballet; Pilar Alvarez and Claudio Hoffmann from Tango Metropolis Argentina; and Desmond Richardson from Complexions. 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570 or (212) 721-6500; $20 to $150. (Rockwell) THUNDERBIRD AMERICAN INDIAN DANCERS (Tonight through Sunday) This year's Pow-Wow, the company's 31st, includes dances, stories and traditional music from the Iroquois and American Indians of the Northwest Coast, the Southwest, the Plains and the Arctic regions. (Repeated next weekend.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at 10th Street, East Village, (212) 254-1109 and www.theaterforthenewcity.net. Evening performances: $10. Matinees: $10; $1 for children under 12 accompanied by a ticketholding adult. (Dunning) THE WALDEN COMPANY (Sunday) A new musical, ''All is Full of Love,'' by the choreographer Josh Walden, is based on the narrative of ''On the Town,'' but set to the music of Bjork. The one-time performance (presumably Mr. Walden is hoping for more) partly benefits Dancers Responding to AIDS. 8 p.m., Theater at St. Clements, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101 or TheaterMania.com; $39.90 to $81.50 (includes preshow reception). (Sulcas) * REGGIE WILSON/FIST & HEEL PERFORMANCE GROUP (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Wilson and his superb musicians and dancers create a world that fuses the cultural traditions of the black American South, urban America, Africa and the Caribbean, this time in ''The Tale: Npinpee Nckutchie and the Tail of the Golden Dek,'' a new work that explores sexual attraction. (Through Feb. 18 and Feb. 22 to 25.) 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077; $25; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hard-wired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh, color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith) * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces which the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter) International Center of Photography: 'Che!: Revolution and commerce,' through Feb. 26. This is, in a sense, a one-image show, the image being Alberto Korda's famous 1960 head shot of Che (Ernesto Guevara), taken in Cuba. But the theme is the transformation that the portrait has undergone in the passage of 46 years, as Che's soulful likeness has migrated from political posters to album covers, T-shirts, paper currency, vodka ads and gallery art. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter) Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average life span was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever-present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness were shots in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 or so objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * MET: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) The Museum of Modern Art: JOHN SZARKOWSKI: 'PHOTOGRAPHS,' through May 15. A kind of homecoming, this beautiful show surveys the pictures taken by Mr. Szarkowski before and after his influential 29-year term at the helm of the Modern's photography department. The best show him combining the styles of the photographers he has long admired with his native ground -- the architecture and landscape of the upper Midwest. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Smith) ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: 'FROM BYZANTIUM TO MODERN GREECE: HELLENIC ART IN ADVERSITY, 1453-1830,' through May 6. This show is a busy, ambitious hodgepodge that sets out to present all aspects of the visual art in Greece during this period. The range spans wonderful early paintings and icons, like a panel by the youthful El Greco; examples of domestic crafts practiced by Greek women; jewelry and church ornaments; and maps and charts. 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448. (Glueck) * P.S. 1: 'Peter Hujar,' through March 6. When Peter Hujar died in 1987, he was a figure of acute interest to a small group of fans, and unknown to practically everyone else. His photographs of desiccated corpses in Sicilian catacombs and studio portraits of New York's downtown demimonde were a gorgeous shock, and their cocktail of Nadar, Weegee and Vogue shaped the work of many younger artists. This surveyish sampling includes several of his recurrent themes: portraits of people and animals, landscapes, still lifes and erotica. Sensuality and mortality are the binders throughout, inseparable. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Cotter) * Studio Museum in Harlem: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Raymond Pettibon,' through Feb. 19. If you are unfamiliar with the influential Mr. Pettibon's emotionally resonant mix of noirish cartooning and enigmatic literary verbiage, this show of works on paper and, for the first time, a low-tech animated video, serves as a good introduction. (See above.) 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639(Johnson) Galleries: Uptown * Ellen Brooks: Vintage Photographs from the 70's Cultural wars have come and gone -- actually, they've never really gone -- since 1976, when Ellen Brooks first showed a dozen larger-than-life-size studio photographs of nude male and female adolescents. Eight more pictures, never before exhibited, from the same series are on view at Roth, and it is easy to see how, in the right (meaning wrong) setting, they could still cause a fuss today. The inclusion of documentation, including early reviews of the work, give these remarkable pictures a historical context. Andrew Roth, 160A East 70th Street, (212) 717-9067, through Feb. 18. (Cotter) The Hudson River School at the New-York Historical Society: Nature and the American Vision By the mid-19th century, the United States was a trans-Atlantic political power in search of a cultural profile. Hudson River School landscape painting was the answer: it presented America as the un-Europe. Europe had its Romantic ruins; America had its ultra-Romantic wilderness. Europe had antique; America had primeval. Europe told time in centuries; America told time in eons. It's all here to see in this display of a venerable local institution's permanent collection. New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, through Feb. 19. (Cotter) Galleries: 57th Street * Maria Elena González This excellent two-gallery show plays with the forms of Roman Catholic religious imagery and reliquaries that Ms. González encountered during a yearlong stay in Rome, but translates both into highly personal post-Minimalist forms. The symbols of martyrdom at the Project become emblems of power; the clouded architectural sculptures at Knoedler look like reliquaries within reliquaries, which is one way to speak of the relationship of memory to art. The Project, 37 West 57th Street, third floor, (212) 688-1585, through Feb. 17, and Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, through March 4. (Cotter) * 'RON NAGLE AND THE HOLY GRAIl' Nominally, the 12 absurdly beautiful little ceramic objects that make up Mr. Nagel's eighth New York solo show are teacups. But an exquisite combination of sculptural form, color, surface and craftsmanship elevates each to a transcendental realm of pure aesthetic contemplation. They are smart and slyly humorous, too. Garth Clark, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 246-2205, through Feb. 25. (Ken Johnson) JOHN SZARKOWSKI: 'NOW' As a pendant to the photographer's survey at the Museum of Modern art, this show focuses on images of the land and outbuildings on his upstate farm, with special attention to the seasonal changes and akimbo branches of numerous apple trees. Pace/MacGill Gallery, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7999, through Feb. 18. (Smith) Galleries: Chelsea WILLIE COLE: SOLE TO SOUL An adept recycler of found objects used as tools or in assemblages to evoke different varieties of African sculpture, Mr. Cole has expanded both palette and references in his latest efforts. Here women's high heels, arranged by hue, handsomely evoke rose windows, mandalas and lotus flowers, as well as religious multiplicity (Smith). Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 367-7474, through Feb. 18. (Smith) Molly Davies This expansive show features major works from three decades by a veteran avant-gardist film and video maker. Ranging from near-abstraction to dreamlike allegory, the video installations of Ms. Davies call to mind artists as various as Gary Hill and Bill Viola. Some involve collaboration with musicians and dancers, and the esteemed poet Anne Carson stars in a sensuous and stately three-screen production from 2002 called ''Desire.'' Zone, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 255-2177, through Feb. 18. (Johnson) ERWIN OLAF The large, carefully staged photographs of people in midcentury American clothes and environments by this successful Dutch commercial photographer look like the dreams of a deeply depressed Norman Rockwell. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, through Feb. 18. (Johnson) Wu Jian'an: 'Daydreams' Trained in the art of paper cutting, this young Chinese artist scissors swirling, wonderfully intricate and fantastic compositions of figures, body parts and animals from single large sheets of white paper. Chambers, 210 11th Avenue, between 24th and 25th Streets, (212) 414-1169, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo 'It's a Beautiful Day' Sweet but with an acid center, this group show includes Mie Yim's smudgy painting of stuffed animals in an overripe landscape; Charlene Liu's pale watercolor vision of wrecked cars in an overgrown valley; Satoru Eguchi's architectural photographs cut into lacy patterns; Margaret Lee's watercolor pictures of rock formations with graffiti carved into them; Saeko Takagi's pastel-colored paintings of wan, blond models; Misaki Kawai's funky, storytelling marine sculptures; and Koji Shimizu's sculpture in the form of climbing equipment for cats. ISE Cultural Foundation, 555 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 925-1649, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) Other Galleries Carla Accardi and Lucio Fontana,: 'Infinite Space' Bridging the gap between higher metaphysics and raw materialism in Italy in the 1960's and 70's, Fontana famously made single-color canvases that he decisively slashed or punctured, while Accardi wrapped strips of painted transparent plastic around wooden stretchers or painted fields of optically vibrating calligraphy. A selection of works by both artists makes for a surprisingly handsome and elegant show that is nicely complemented by a small installation ofrecent works by Richard Tuttle in the project room. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 999-7337, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) * 'Do You Think I'm Disco' There's a big story to be told about disco culture of the 1970's, which had roots in rhythm and blues, African-American church music, 1960's drug culture, gay liberation and all manner of anti-establishment politics. This modest group show touches on all of these elements, however glancingly and unsystematically, by considering the trickle-down effect of discomania on some new art today. Longwood Art Gallery@Hostos, 450 Grand Concourse, at 149th Street, Mott Haven, the Bronx, (718) 518-6728, through March 18. (Cotter) * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed, punk and new wave rock assailed the ears, graffiti spread like kudzu and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her deathbed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck) * Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson) Last Chance MARIA MAGDALENA CAMPOS-PONS: backyard dreams See this show for the large, gorgeously colored multiphoto works in which drawing, painting and photography merge with intimations of the female, otherness and a distinctly tropical locale. Julie Saul Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-2410; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * 'DAVID HAMMONS: THE UNAUTHORIZED RETROSPECTIVE' How do you do a show if you don't have art? Use copies. How do you get copies? Find photographs of the original art. That's what Triple Candie has done with David Hammons's work. The gallery photocopied illustrations of existing, or once existing, Hammons pieces from books and magazines and downloaded others from the Internet. They then taped the 81/2 -by-11 prints to the gallery wall. The result: a homage that is very much in this important artist's maverick, dematerialized spirit. Triple Candie, 461 West 126th Street, Harlem, (212) 865-0783; closes Sunday.(Cotter) * Warren Isensee Could this be Mr. Isensee's breakout show? His glowing grid, striped and concentric rectangle paintings play adroitly with conventions of Modernist abstraction and are almost hallucinogenically beautiful. Danese, 535 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 223-2227; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) CHRISTOPHER MINER: HOW BEAUTIFUL HEAVEN MUST BE In this split-personality debut, the artist mimics a drunken black man in one video, and in another, takes a remorseful, memory-laden tour of his dead grandparents' house. The prevailing impression is of white, male, not necessarily Southern emptiness and disconnection. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 744-7400; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OSCAR BLUEMNER: A PASSION FOR COLOR,' Not exactly a well-known name today, except to devotees of American Modernism, this German-born architect-turned-painter (1867-1938) was one of the major American artists of the early 20th century, right up there with the likes of Marsden Hartley, John Marin, Arthur Dove and Charles Demuth, to name a few. Most of his compositions are unpeopled landscapes depicting houses and building fragments in brilliantly stylized settings in which trees, clouds, smokestacks, telephone poles, water and snow are rendered as rhythmic and dramatic shapes that play off one another almost musically. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676; closes Sunday. (Glueck)

VWITH the closing of the Village of Mamaroneck's day-laborer hiring site and the increasing uneasiness about illegal immigration in communities throughout the suburbs, Bernice Spreckman, a county legislator, called a special meeting in White Plains last Tuesday to hear out local leaders on the subject of managing day-laborer sites. William Paonessa, a Mamaroneck trustee who is also deputy mayor, used the occasion to explain his village's decision -- which he called temporary -- to shut its official hiring site at Columbus Park, next to the Metro-North station, on Feb. 2. The site, he said, had been drawing too many illegal immigrants from surrounding communities.

VIN the end, all the smiley-face buttons on earth couldn't prevent it: after eight seasons of blasting Cheap Trick and testing the limits of polyester leisurewear, the kids from ''That 70's Show'' will soon have their trippiest encounter yet -- with 1980. The New Year's party, the series finale, which will be broadcast in May, brings to a close 200 episodes of freaky good times among Wisconsin teenagers in the Jimmy Carter era. Although it rarely cracked the Nielsen Top 20, the series has been one of television's longest-running live-action comedies (second on Fox only to ''Married With Children''). Along the way, it has introduced a corps of popular young actors, including Ashton Kutcher and Topher Grace.

VTough, tattooed and conspicuously shy, Jaheim just might be the least flamboyant R&B star of his generation. Mellow without ever coming across as soft, he is equally at home alongside a rapper or an old-fashioned string section. Either way, he sounds less like a combatant in the battle of the sexes and more like a man who has already lost it. His lovesick ballads have traces of regret and helplessness: he sings like a prisoner of war. Jaheim has spent his career refining a particular romantic ideal. If you're wondering which ideal that is, you need only know that his three major-label albums all have ''ghetto'' in their titles. The third, ''Ghetto Classics'' (Divine Mills/Warner Brothers), was released on Tuesday, Valentine's Day. And that night he came to the Newark Symphony Hall for a charming and sometimes awkward record-release concert.

VApproval for Sanofi-Aventis's experimental drug for weight loss, Acomplia, was delayed yesterday by the Food and Drug Administration, which issued what it calls an ''approvable'' letter but said the company must meet certain conditions before the product could receive final clearance. An F.D.A. spokeswoman, Kathleen Quinn, said the agency would not disclose exactly what regulators wanted before Acomplia could be marketed, so the extent of the delay was not clear.

VI AM skiing uphill in the dark. It's been raining for six hours. I am following a pair of tracks threading between pine trees. Now and then, the beam of my headlamp catches a reflective marker high on a trunk, so I guess I'm going the right way. My destination is the Ostrander Ski Hut, a cabin in the backcountry of Yosemite National Park, nine miles from the nearest road. Since leaving the Badger Pass parking lot just before noon with my friends Tim, Jeff and Nettie, except for an hour on a groomed trail, I've been climbing steadily through forest.

VINTERNATIONAL 3-17 Tension as Hamas Takes Reins A new Palestinian Parliament dominated by the militant group Hamas was installed and, within hours, President Mahmoud Abbas and Hamas lawmakers set out on a collision course over the need to honor existing agreements with Israel and conduct negotiations to achieve Palestinian statehood. 1 German Plane Missing in Iraq An American soldier and three Iraqi policemen were killed in two separate roadside bomb attacks in Baghdad, while Iraqi and American forces in the mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan searched for a missing plane that was carrying five German businessmen. 14 The Rolling Stones in Rio More than one and a half million people, according to the police and other authorities, flocked to Copacabana Beach in Brazil for a free concert starring the Rolling Stones. 10 No New Survivors of Mudslide Rescuers struggling through soft, thick mud found bodies but no more survivors of the mountain collapse that buried a southern Philippines town the day before, apparently killing almost all of its 1,800 residents. Witnesses said there was no longer any sign of the town. 6 Shirt Spurs Resignation A day after at least 11 people were killed in Libya amid continuing violence over the Danish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, an Italian government minister resigned for wearing a T-shirt printed with the cartoons. In Nigeria, Muslims protesting the cartoons attacked Christians and burned churches, killing at least 15 people. 16 Whale Deaths Puzzle Mexico Mexican authorities are investigating the mysterious deaths of eight whales found washed ashore along the Sea of Cortez last month, an unusually large number that suggests someone or something is killing them off. 9 NATIONAL 18-30 Drug Smuggling's Critical Link In the eyes of law enforcement, Indian reservations have become a critical link in the drug underworld, helping traffickers transport high-potency marijuana and Ecstasy from eastern Canada into cities like Buffalo, Boston and New York. 1 G.O.P. Mainstay May Waver Older voters, a critical component of Republican Congressional victories for more than a decade, could end up being a major vulnerability for the party in this year's midterm elections, according to strategists in both parties. Paradoxically, one reason is the new Medicare drug benefit, which was intended to cement their loyalty. 1 Mardi Gras Returns in Big Easy This year's Mardi Gras season began in New Orleans with five parades marking the beginning of the annual celebration. It is the first Mardi Gras since Hurricane Katrina altered the physical and psychic landscape of the city nearly six months ago. 1 Getting enough of the kind of soil that can stand up to future hurricanes is one of the greatest challenges of the levee rebuilding effort in New Orleans. But critics say the new construction is likely to fail again. 22 OBITUARIES 40 George T. Davis A criminal lawyer who gained fame in high-profile cases, he was 98. 40 NEW YORK/REGION 33-39 The City's Growing Population The population of New York City is expected to pass nine million by 2020. With higher birth rates among Hispanic and Asian New Yorkers, immigrants' continued gravitaton to the city and a housing boom, the city is struggling to cope. 33 Neediest Cases 37 Chess 39 Weather 41

VHe had eluded the authorities for years. Witnesses against him had mysteriously disappeared. Shots were fired from his highly secured compound here last year when the state police tried to close in. The man, John V. Oakes, like a fast-rising number of American Indian drug traffickers across the country, saw himself as ''untouchable,'' as one senior investigator put it, protected by armed enforcers and a code of silence that ruled the reservation.

Standing behind a trove of Chinese assault rifles, Beretta knockoffs from Brazil and other weapons, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said during a news conference at Police Headquarters that the seizure of more than 100 firearms was the largest in recent years.

VIt is increasingly expensive to be a criminal. Beverly Dubois, a 49-year-old former park ranger in Washington State, spent nine months in jail for growing and selling marijuana. She still owes the state almost $1,900 for court costs and various fees. Until she pays up, the state has taken away her right to vote.

VLONG before he became a judge, Juan Guzmán Tapia revered the rule of law. So it may be the supreme irony of his career that he will be forever associated with a man notorious for his disrespect for the law: Gen. Augusto Pinochet. Take, for example, the autobiography Mr. Guzmán published last year after retiring from the judiciary. He titled it ''At the Edge of the World,'' but his publicity-conscious publisher insisted it carry the subtitle, ''Memoirs of the Judge Who Prosecuted Pinochet.''

VJulia Mancuso stood in the start gate staring into a blinding snowstorm. Somewhere, several hundred feet below, through 42 gates and countless blowing snowflakes, was the finish line. From a grandstand she could not see, she heard cowbells. At the periphery of the slope, she heard the course maintenance workers calling her name -- Italians rooting for an Italian-American they had adopted as their own.

VA marijuana activist who tried to change his name to NJWeedman.com is giving up on the Garden State and moving to California. Ed Forchion, an advocate and perennial political candidate, told The Philadelphia Inquirer last week that he is moving to Los Angeles. ''I've had a run of bad luck,'' he said. Since December, he has lost the right to visit his daughter, hit a deer with his truck, blown out his transmission and declared himself indigent. He said he will run a cannabis club -- and provide spiritual guidance -- in the Los Angeles area. Mr. Forchion, who lives in Pemberton Township, has become an institution in protest politics and being a jailhouse lawyer. He has lighted up marijuana in protest at the State House in Trenton and on federally owned land near the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. After he was arrested for possession with intent to distribute more than 40 pounds of marijuana in 1997, he tried to seek political asylum in Cuba. It did not work out. And there was the name-change effort, which Mr. Forchion thought might increase his name recognition on ballots. A judge denied it in 2004. A former candidate for pretty much every public office in New Jersey, Mr. Forchion finished fifth in last year's gubernatorial race .

VStripping convicted felons of the right to vote is a slap at America's democratic ideals. Many states are backing away from this policy, understanding at last that voting rights are in fact basic human rights that should be abridged only in the rarest circumstances. That lesson has yet to penetrate the state of Washington, which has created a form of disenfranchisement that is straight out of ''Oliver Twist.'' Last week, an article by The Times's Adam Liptak introduced us to a disabled woman named Beverly Dubois who lost the right to vote because she could not pay about $1,600 of charges that were assessed in connection with her marijuana conviction. The debt is growing rapidly because of the interest charged by the state. Ms. Dubois, who served nine months in jail, has paid her debt to society. But until she settles the one to the state, she is stripped of her rights as a citizen. Disabled in a car accident, she can send in only $10 per month. At that rate, she is likely to die before paying off the debt.

VBritten Score Surfaces A 15-year search for a vanished Benjamin Britten score has been ended by a casual conversation with a retired banker who is to turn 100 this year. Britten (1913-1976), below, wrote the music as a setting for a 1937 English broadcast that included the W. H. Auden poem ''Roman Wall Blues,'' about a disillusioned soldier on guard duty in the northern extremes of the ancient empire (''Over the heather the wet wind blows,/ I've lice in my tunic and cold in my nose. ''). Now the score is to be displayed in England at the Aldeburgh Festival in June and perhaps performed next year at the Sage Gateshead concert hall, near Newcastle, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the broadcast and the centenary of the birth of Auden, The Guardian of London reported. The search for the score was initiated by John Mapplebeck, a filmmaker whose company plans a project about the broadcast. Years after his newspaper appeal for information proved fruitless, he happened to mention his search to Philip Pendrel-Smith, a retired banker whom he drives to evensong every Sunday. Mr. Pendrel-Smith said he once was an actor, was involved in the broadcast and picked up and kept the music after the broadcast. The score has been sent to the Britten-Pears Library in Aldeburgh. ''It's a treasure,'' said the librarian, Chris Grogan. Coming Up At the Roundabout Broadway revivals of Shaw's ''Heartbreak House'' and the musical ''110 in the Shade,'' as well as the American premieres of plays by Patrick Marber and Brian Friel and appearances by Philip Bosco, Audra McDonald and Alfred Molina, will be part of the 2006-07 Roundabout Theater Company season. ''Heartbreak House,'' starring Mr. Bosco as Captain Shotover, will open in the winter. Ms. McDonald, a four-time Tony Award winner, will star in ''110 in the Shade,'' by the team of Harvey Schmidt and Tom Jones (''The Fantasticks''), based on the N. Richard Nash play ''The Rainmaker.'' It will open in spring 2007. Mr. Molina will star in Mr. Marber's ''Howard Katz.'' This tale of a down-on-his-luck talent agent opens off Broadway in the winter. Mr. Friel's play, opening off Broadway in spring or summer next year, is ''The Home Place.'' Set in 1878, it tells of a widower, his son and the woman they both love in an era of political unrest in Ireland. Surgery for Sheryl Crow The Grammy Award-winning singer Sheryl Crow underwent surgery for breast cancer last Wednesday in Los Angeles and is recovering without complications, The Associated Press reported. On her Web site, Ms. Crow, 44, said the surgery was ''minimally invasive'' and added that she planned to undergo radiation treatment as a precaution. She canceled North American tour dates in March and April. Footnotes The British singer George Michael said yesterday that he did have drugs when he was arrested on Saturday after he was found slumped in a car in central London, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Michael, 42, was held on suspicion of possessing Class C drugs, a group that includes marijuana, tranquilizers and painkillers. He was released on bail pending a return in late March. ''I was in possession of Class C drugs which is an offense, and I have no complaints about the police who were professional throughout,'' he said in a statement.

VThe Bush administration published an annual report Wednesday on international narcotics control, listing its accomplishments in disrupting the production and trafficking of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and other drugs to the United States. But perhaps the most important measure of the programs' efficacy was issued just a few weeks ago, when the White House drug-policy office reported that ''cocaine is widely available throughout most of the nation.'' The office offered similar assessments for heroin and marijuana.

VRamondo Jack and Romona Moore were raised three-tenths of a mile apart in East Flatbush, Brooklyn. The last time Mr. Jack saw Ms. Moore, on a visit to the old neighborhood, he said, she was lying on a basement floor, stripped to her underwear and chained by the neck and arms. Her eyes were blackened, her face swollen and bloodied, her voice weak from crying. Mr. Jack walked out of that basement, joined his family across the street, shopped for a new outfit, attended a baby shower and then drove back to his new home in Maryland, he testified in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn yesterday.

VA tax lawyer who worked at a prominent Manhattan firm has been indicted on charges of paying two teenage girls for sex and paying their mother to allow it. He was arrested in Grimsby, Ontario, last week, but was released, for reasons that were not immediately clear, and is considered a fugitive, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney said. The lawyer, James Colliton, 42, formerly of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, invited one of the girls, then 15, to his Midtown apartment in 2000 and gave her alcohol and marijuana for sex, according to a statement yesterday from the office of District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau. Mr. Colliton continued having sex with her through 2004, the statement said.

VA federal magistrate judge sentenced Marion S. Barry Jr., 70, a former mayor of Washington and a current member of the City Council, to three years of probation for failing to pay taxes. The judge, Deborah A. Robinson, also ordered Mr. Barry to comply with any drug treatment or counseling requirements imposed by the probation office. Mr. Barry tested positive for cocaine and marijuana use in a court-ordered drug test last year. He pleaded guilty in October to two misdemeanor charges for failing to file his income tax returns for 2000. Mr. Barry served three terms as mayor from 1978 to 1990 before spending six months in prison for drug possession. He then served another term as mayor from 1994 to 1998 and was elected to the Council in 2004. JOHN FILES (NYT)

VMortimo Planno, a philosopher regarded as a key figure in the development of the Rastafarian religion, died Monday at the University of the West Indies in Kingston. He was 85. His death followed complications from a thyroid condition, said Barry Chevannes, a longtime friend and anthropology professor at the university. Mr. Planno was one of the most influential people in the development of Rastafarianism, a sect whose members mostly regard Africa as the promised land and Haile Selassie as a divine figure.

VWHO'S in? Who's out? Who should be barred at the door? The Baseball Hall of Fame has been a lightning rod for outrage these past two weeks, with attendant confusion about the currency by which one obtains sporting immortality. First came the uproar over the Hall's election of 17 dead obscurities of African-American baseball while neglecting Buck O'Neil, who at 94 is the living symbol of the Negro Leagues and, since his star turn in Ken Burns's documentary ''Baseball,'' a national hero. Now come the calls for Barry Bonds to have his records stripped, his carcass flayed and his path to the Hall blocked because of revelations or allegations (depending upon one's point of view or, it has been suggested, race) that he has for years been souping up his engine with substances dangerous to his own health as well as that of pitchers.

In reviewing a batch of fragrances hitting the market soon, I was astonished to find four terrific new manly scents. And one couldn't be more different from the next.

VAt this point, Willie Nelson is a national monument. One of country music's most fertile songwriters, tireless performers and distinctive vocal interpreters, he is also a longtime ambassador between red and blue states of mind; he has been pals with presidents, allegedly smoked marijuana on the White House roof (and just about everywhere else), founded Farm Aid to assist family farms and recently launched his own biodiesel fuel company. And Mr. Nelson has made dozens of records -- some would say too many, as the quality has been variable. But this year he's on a roll. In addition to campaigning for hurricane relief and the usual endless touring, he has released -- in light of the media attention surrounding the hit film ''Brokeback Mountain'' -- a touching version of Ned Sublette's gay cowboy homage ''Cowboys Are Frequently Secretly (Fond of Each Other)'' as an exclusive single on iTunes. And this month, Mr. Nelson, 72, will release a record of pop and country classics titled ''Songs of Cindy Walker.''

VWith clipped tones and a shy, retiring manner, a convicted marijuana dealer took the stand yesterday in the trial of Louis J. Eppolito and Stephen Caracappa and told jurors that the two retired New York detectives had served as killers for the mob, murdering at least two men and kidnapping another on its behalf. It was the first time in the week-old federal racketeering trial that any witness has directly implicated the men, who stand accused of taking part in at least eight murders for Brooklyn's Luchese crime family. Speaking tersely with his hands in his lap, the witness, Burton Kaplan, said the two detectives not only shot and killed a Gambino family captain and a jeweler from Long Island, but also passed on secret police intelligence to Anthony Casso, the Luchese underboss, who used it to track down his own murder victims.

VThe defense lawyers in the racketeering trial of two retired detectives, Louis J. Eppolito and Stephen Caracappa, had their first chance yesterday to cross-examine the government's chief witness, Burton Kaplan, a geriatric marijuana dealer. In four hours on the stand, Mr. Kaplan maintained his mild, measured manner, confessing only to having let down his daughter with his life of crime --''She lost a lot of respect for me''-- and admitting to little more than not telling the government about a civil lawsuit filed against him by the Swiss American National Bank of Antigua.

VTo look at him, one might never guess that Burton Kaplan devoted 40 years to a protean life of crime. Short, bald, meek, myopic, Mr. Kaplan is an unassuming presence, an aging man from Brooklyn with more than a vague resemblance to the low-rent hucksters who gather every week for pastrami sandwiches in Woody Allen's ''Broadway Danny Rose.''

VBlack men in the United States face a far more dire situation than is portrayed by common employment and education statistics, a flurry of new scholarly studies warn, and it has worsened in recent years even as an economic boom and a welfare overhaul have brought gains to black women and other groups. Focusing more closely than ever on the life patterns of young black men, the new studies, by experts at Columbia, Princeton, Harvard and other institutions, show that the huge pool of poorly educated black men are becoming ever more disconnected from the mainstream society, and to a far greater degree than comparable white or Hispanic men.

VThe federal trial of Louis J. Eppolito and Stephen Caracappa veered yesterday from Brooklyn murder and Las Vegas lunacy to the poker game played by the authorities and turncoats when the trial's star witness told the jury of the immense pressure placed on him to cooperate against the two defendants. It was a brief but fascinating window into tactics used by federal agents once they believe a criminal has fallen into their hands. The witness, Burton Kaplan, an aging marijuana dealer, testified that after his arrest in 1996 on drug and tax evasion charges, ''the government was willing to go to any length'' to make him ''crack'' and come ''on board to provide information'' against Mr. Eppolito, 57, and Mr. Caracappa, 64.

VAn 18-year-old from Bedford, N.Y., who was involved in two separate car accidents that killed a friend and left another friend seriously injured, was charged yesterday with vehicular manslaughter and 11 other counts, said Janet DiFiore, the Westchester County district attorney. Toxicology tests showed that the teenager, Ralph Tarchine, had been under the influence of marijuana at the time of the first accident, on Dec. 10, in which his friend Michael Plunkett, 17, was killed, the authorities said. On Jan. 27, Mr. Tarchine was involved in a second accident and the authorities said that he was drunk. Mr. Tarchine faces up to seven years in prison if convicted of vehicular manslaughter, said Lucian Chalfen, a spokesman for the district attorney's office. Mr. Tarchine was released on bail.

VRoaring west again, the Brooklyn trial of two detectives charged with being hit men for the mob descended yesterday into the desert underworld as a bronzed and beefy government witness told the jury how he moved through Las Vegas, secretly recording mobsters at a community center for the elderly and acting as the house accountant for exotic dancers at a strip club called the Crazy Horse Too. The witness, Steven Corso, is a suntanned C.P.A. who started working with the government in late 2002 after he was caught embezzling $5.4 million from a number of his clients. His testimony overflowed with lunatic accounts of a Vegas mobster in the escort and carpet businesses and of a six-room office suite -- built for Mr. Corso by federal agents -- equipped with hidden microphones and cameras.

VThus far, the witnesses at the trial of two retired detectives accused of killing for the mob have included an old marijuana dealer, a murderous mob boss, a suntanned C.P.A. and a grieving Brooklyn mother whose son was mistakenly shot outside her house one Christmas Day. Nonetheless, the federal trial in Brooklyn turned yesterday to what may have been its weirdest witness yet, or at least most professionally complicated: the former lawyer for a government witness. His attorney-client privilege waived, the lawyer bolstered the witness's account that he once served as the liaison between the detectives, Louis Eppolito and Stephen Caracappa, and their patron in the mob.

VI. A WALK IN THE WOODS Walking with a loaded rifle in an unfamiliar forest bristling with the signs of your prey is thrilling. It embarrasses me to write that, but it is true. I am not by nature much of a noticer, yet here, now, my attention to everything around me, and deafness to everything else, is complete. Nothing in my experience has prepared me for the quality of this attention. I notice how the day's first breezes comb the needles in the pines, producing a sotto voce whistle and an undulation in the pattern of light and shadow tattooing the tree trunks and the ground. I notice the specific density of the air. But this is not a passive or aesthetic attention; it is a hungry attention, reaching out into its surroundings like fingers, or nerves. My eyes venture deep into thickets my body could never penetrate, picking their way among the tangled branches, sliding over rocks and around stumps to bring back the slenderest hint of movement. In the places too deeply shadowed to admit my eyes, my ears roam at will, returning with the report of a branch cracking at the bottom of a ravine, or the snuffling of a. . .wait: what was that? Just a bird. Everything is amplified. Even my skin is alert, so that when the shadow launched by the sudden ascent of a turkey vulture passes overhead I swear I can feel the temperature momentarily fall. I am the alert man.

VBeneath the murders, the mobsters, the gamblers, the strippers, the tax cheats, diamond smugglers, thieves, hoods, cops, cons, corpses, crooks and marijuana dealers, there is -- at the core -- a book. It is the 251-page memoir ''Mafia Cop,'' and it sits at the center of the most macabre and bizarre racketeering trial to unfold in years. Its author, Louis J. Eppolito, a retired New York detective, is the chief defendant in the case, a transcontinental drama in which he stands accused, along with his former partner, Stephen Caracappa, of committing drug crimes in Las Vegas after taking part in at least eight Brooklyn murders for the mob.

VTHE parties my father votes for never get into Parliament. One year he'll vote for some economist with thick glasses who promises a revolution in tax law, the next year for an irate teacher with a ponytail who advocates a revolution in the school system, the year after that for a restaurateur in Jaffa who explains that only a new culinary approach can bring peace to the Middle East. The one thing these candidates have in common is a genuine desire for fundamental change. That and the naiveté to believe such change is possible. My father, even at the age of 78, is naïve enough to believe this, too. It's one of his finest qualities.

VIn Elizabethan dramas, the cast of characters is wildly diverse, ranging from the noble lords and kings to the lowly fools and scullery maids.

VThe candykids, juggalos, groovers and burners are uniting here with fresh purpose this week. Dancing to the synthesized music that binds them together, planting memorials of candles and their signature beaded bracelets, they join together not to rave, but to mourn slain friends. One woman had a rainbow of yarn woven into her hair. Two men had faces painted in red and black. A man in a suit and tie had a pinkish mohawk. Dozens of others wore baggy clothing or unremarkable dress. All showed up on Tuesday at a spring-green park with a spectacular view of the Space Needle.

VRoyal Blue Boon was a champion and big money-earner in the equine calf-herding sport known as cutting. Comes now her genetic knock-off: Royal Blue Boon Too, whose birth last month was, her creators say, the start of commercial horse cloning. The births of Too and the clone of a second star cutting mare, Tap O Lena, were announced yesterday by two Texas companies -- ViaGen, a cloning company, and Encore Genetics, a horse-breeding and marketing company. Seven more clones of champion horses are scheduled to be born this year, the companies said.

VON Christmas Eve, 1989, a small force of about 100 men led by an obscure former Liberian government official crossed the border from Ivory Coast into Nimba County in northern Liberia. According to local legend, recounted by the Africa scholar Stephen Ellis in his book ''The Mask of Anarchy,'' a baby born in Monrovia, Liberia's capital, miraculously spoke English straight from the womb. It told its mother that a rain of death would fall Christmas Day, and that it did not want to live in such a vicious world, and promptly drew its last breath.

A1 A federal jury found that Zacarias Moussaoui was responsible for some of the deaths that occurred during the Sept. 11 attacks and is thus eligible to be executed. A1 Standoff on Benefits Programs President Bush and the Senate are at an impasse over the appointment of trustees for Social Security and Medicare, crippling the panel that supervises the two programs.

VFor Cathy and Bill Powell, finding a time when all three of their children are home for dinner can be like working a Rubik's Cube. A recent Monday was typical: Valerie, 9, got home from dance class at 6:35. Brian, 10, had to leave for Boy Scouts at 6:50. That left 15 minutes to sit down for tacos. ''I actually have to take all their schedules and make calendars and put things in different colors,'' said Mrs. Powell, of Wantagh, N.Y.

VChronically ill patients who want to use medicinal marijuana began submitting applications under a new state law. In January, Rhode Island became the first state to sanction the use of medical marijuana since the Supreme Court ruled that the authorities could prosecute marijuana users, even in states that allow it to be used medicinally. Four people submitted applications, and 51 others are being completed, said Maria Wah-Fitta, a spokeswoman for the Rhode Island Department of Health. The state has 30 days to verify with a physician that the patient is eligible for the program. A patient and a caretaker can possess up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana or up to 12 plants. The patient and caretaker must carry cards that identify them as part of the program at all times. KATIE ZEZIMA (NYT)

VTwo highly decorated former New York City detectives were convicted yesterday of using their gold shields and the flashing lights of an unmarked patrol car to enhance their true role: that of mob assassins who helped to kill at least eight men in one of the most spectacular police corruption scandals in the city's history. The verdict, coming 20 years after their first victim, Israel Greenwald, was gunned down in a parking garage and 13 months after both defendants, Louis Eppolito and Stephen Caracappa, were arrested at the coat check of a Nevada restaurant, brought to a close a trial that stretched from the gangland prefectures of southern Brooklyn to the palm-lined subdivisions of Las Vegas.

VShawn Kemp sat in a Seattle jail cell for four hours last April. His weight had ballooned to 330 pounds and he knew he would have to explain to the Little League team he was coaching why he had been arrested. ''When a person gets to the age of 35 and you go to jail, it either makes you or breaks you,'' Kemp said last week in a telephone interview. ''It made me identify what I wanted. It's how you want to be remembered. Are you going to fight for it or just lay down?''

VPRO FOOTBALL RICKY WILLIAMS WAITS FOR RULING -- Dolphins running back Ricky Williams and his lawyer met yesterday with Jeff Pash, general counsel for the N.F.L., in an effort to have the league overturn a positive drug test that could cost Williams the 2006 season. If the positive test is upheld, it will be Williams's fourth violation of the N.F.L.'s substance-abuse policy, meaning at least a one-year suspension. Previous positive tests were for marijuana. GRIEVANCE AGAINST TITANS -- The N.F.L. Players Association filed a grievance against the Titans on behalf of quarterback Steve McNair. The grievance accuses the team of breaching McNair's contract when he was barred from working out at the team's facility on Monday.

V9 P.M. (Lifetime) THE ACCIDENTAL WITNESS -- Natasha Gregson Wagner (right), Natalie Wood's 35-year-old daughter, stars in this television movie as a lawyer pursued by a killer. He believes she witnessed one of his crimes. 8 P.M. (Fox) PRISON BREAK -- Michael (Wentworth Miller, now an official covermodel hunk) is in the psychiatric ward freaking out because part of his tattoo is missing. As most people who have even heard of this drama series know, the tattoo is a map of the entire prison facility. Two other inmates, C-Note (Rockmond Dunbar) and Tbag (Robert Knepper), play poker. 8 P.M. (NBC) CELEBRITY COOKING SHOWDOWN -- Wolfgang Puck is one of the famous chefs in this five-night series. Tom Arnold (near left, with Mr. Puck) is one of the celebrities who will be partnered with chefs. Gael Greene is one of the judges. 8 P.M. (11) 7TH HEAVEN -- Everybody in the family seems to have a secret about a wedding ring. 9 P.M. (Fox) 24 -- ''Day 5: 12 P.M.-1 A.M.'' As this show's fifth season and fifth terrorist crisis near their close, martial law is still in effect. And there's a significant reunion: Jack (Kiefer Sutherland), Audrey (Kim Raver) and the Secretary of Defense (William Devane). 9 P.M. (11) EVERWOOD -- Rose (Merrilyn Gann) smokes medical marijuana. Andy and Jake (Treat Williams and Scott Wolf) save a drunk driver. 10 P.M. (ABC) WHAT ABOUT BRIAN -- Brian (Barry Watson) sets out to hook up (as we say now) with two different women in one day. 10 P.M. (CBS) CSI: MIAMI -- A tsunami is heading toward Florida. 10 P.M. (NBC) MEDIUM -- Viewers must ask just how many dreams Allison DuBois (Patricia Arquette), psychic heroine, is going to have about murder victims and how many serial killers she is going to foresee before this generally smart series runs its course. But Allison's daughter Bridgette (Maria Lark) does have an unusual problem. Asked to make a school presentation about her parents' careers, how is she going to explain her mother? 1:20 A.M. (Cinemax) THE ACCUSED -- (1988). Jodie Foster (below) won her first best actress Oscar for her role as a fun-loving bluecollar woman who is gang-raped and then finds her character, rather than her attackers, on trial. Kelly McGillis plays the prosecutor, who believes the men who cheered them on are guilty, too. ANITA GATES

VThe right to counsel is a bedrock constitutional principle, guaranteed to criminal defendants by the Sixth Amendment. But what about the right to a particular lawyer? What about a defendant who wants the best, and can pay for it, but who is required as the result of improper government intervention to settle for second best, or worse? The issue in a Supreme Court argument on Tuesday was what remedy defendants can invoke when they have been improperly deprived of their choice of lawyer.

VA 26-year-old Bronx man was charged with murder yesterday, accused of firing the shot that killed a 2 1/2-year-old Bronx boy riding with his family to Easter dinner, the authorities said. The man, Nicholas Morris, was charged with two counts of second-degree murder, as well as other offenses, after witnesses who picked him out in several police lineups said they saw him firing a gun several times into an intersection where the boy's mother was driving the family's minivan about 2 p.m. on Sunday, the police said.

VINTERNATIONAL A3-15 Iraq Breaks Long Impasse Over Disputed Premier Under intense pressure, Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari of Iraq dropped his bid to retain his job, removing an obstacle to forming a new government during a time of rising sectarian violence. Leaders from each of Iraq's main factions called the decision a breakthrough. A1 Little Progress in China Talks President Bush and China's president, Hu Jintao, pledged to cooperate more closely on fighting nuclear proliferation and reducing trade imbalances, but broke no new ground on the most delicate issues that divide the nations. A1 Hamas Builds Force of Militants The new Hamas-appointed Palestinian interior minister named a well-known militant to a senior security position and announced the creation of a new force to be made up of militants. A6 Chad Rebellion a Family Affair President Idriss Déby of Chad, who beat back a rebel assault on the country's capital last week, accuses Sudan of trying to drive him from power. But Mr. Déby's enemies include members of his own family, as many of his kinsmen have left the government army to form rebel forces of their own. A10 Afghan Cabinet Is Approved President Hamid Karzai won approval from Parliament for his reshuffled cabinet in daylong voting, with only 5 of the 25 nominees rejected. A14 European Doubt on C.I.A.

But he came under criticism from some legislators who questioned the hearing's rigor. A14 Berlusconi Seeks Spotlight As Romano Prodi takes his place as Italy's new prime minister and begins assembling a coalition government, the incumbent, Silvio Berlusconi, who has yet to concede the election, will be shaping a strategy of his own to stay in the public view. A3 NATIONAL A16-23 G.O.P. Criticized Over Higher Gas Prices Democrats running for Congress are moving quickly to use the most recent surge in oil and gasoline prices to bash Republicans over energy policy and more broadly the direction of the country. A1 Polygamists in Tax Standoff Thousands of polygamists are engaged in a highly unusual standoff in Utah over property taxes that could ultimately cost them their homes or thrust them into a mainstream America they fear and despise. A22 Arrests of Immigrants Surge The apprehension of more than 1,100 illegal immigrants employed by a pallet supply company, as well as the arrest of seven of its managers, represented the start of a more aggressive federal crackdown on employers, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said. A1 Flaws Cited in Federal Program The federal government's main program for helping the victims of Hurricane Katrina rebuild their homes and businesses, operated by the Small Business Administration, has been plagued by inadequate leadership and poor planning, federal investigators have told Congress. A16 9/11 Plot Discounted The prosecution acknowledged that even the government's chief investigators do not believe the claim by Zacarias Moussaoui that Richard C. Reid, the so-called shoe bomber, was to help him fly a jetliner into the White House on Sept. 11. A18 Ohio Candidates Push Change In a state where the governor has been caught up in a corruption scandal and where the only thing leaving faster than manufacturing jobs are young people, candidates for governor of Ohio are jockeying for the mantle of reform. A21 Change of Counsel for Bush? Joshua B. Bolten, the new White House chief of staff, has raised the possibility of moving Harriet E. Miers from her job as President Bush's counsel. A22 NEW YORK/REGION B1-7 Housing Authority Plans To Raise Rents for Some The New York City Housing Authority said it wants to raise the rents paid by tens of thousands of its better-off tenants to help close a budget gap that has widened as costs have shot up and federal funding has not. A1 Memorial Plan Called Unsafe Gov. George E. Pataki's senior adviser for counter-terrorism, James K. Kallstrom, left, has called on architects of the memorial at ground zero to reconsider several critical aspects of the design that he said would leave it vulnerable to a terrorist attack. B1 Work Continues on Tramway Officials are working to reopen the Roosevelt Island Tramway, which broke down on Tuesday and trapped dozens of people in mid-air for hours. Officials plan to reopen the Tramway once their investigation of its failure is complete. B1 OBITUARIES B8 Scott Crossfield A legendary test pilot of the post-World War II era who was the first person to fly twice the speed of sound, he was 84. B8 Eberhardt Rechtin An electrical engineer and telecommunications expert who helped design the network of earthbound antennas that NASA uses to track radio signals emanating from space, he was 80. B8 SCIENCE/HEALTH F.D.A. Rules Against Marijuana The Food and Drug Administration declared that ''no sound scientific studies'' support the medical use of smoked marijuana, inserting the health agency into yet another fierce political fight. A1 BUSINESS DAY C1-10 Morgan Settles I.P.O. Case J.P. Morgan Chase said it would pay $425 million to settle its part of a class-action lawsuit that contends that dozens of banks cheated investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars from initial public offerings during the 1990's market boom. C1 Two Sides of Enron's Skilling Whether Jeffrey K. Skilling's testimony helped or hurt the defense in his fraud trial will depend on how the jury weighs the two personalities they saw in his eight days on the witness stand -- the vulnerable, emotional, even affable character, and the combative figure who did not like to be questioned. C1 Proxy's Possible Conflict A memo written in 2004 by Hank McKinnell, Pfizer's chief executive, urging corporations to buy and promote Proxy Governance's services just as the firm was opening for business, raises questions about the advisory firm's recent show of support for Pfizer's board of directors.

VThe Bush administration's habit of politicizing its scientific agencies was on display again this week when the Food and Drug Administration, for no compelling reason, unexpectedly issued a brief, poorly documented statement disputing the therapeutic value of marijuana. The statement was described as a response to numerous inquiries from Capitol Hill, but its likely intent was to buttress a crackdown on people who smoke marijuana for medical purposes and to counteract state efforts to legalize the practice. Ordinarily, when the F.D.A. addresses a thorny issue, it convenes a panel of experts who wade through the latest evidence and then render an opinion as to whether a substance is safe and effective to use. This time the agency simply issued a skimpy one-page statement asserting that ''no sound scientific studies'' supported the medical use of marijuana.

VFOR thousands of people -- we'll probably never know exactly how many -- Hurricane Katrina was the end. But for listeners across the country, that not-quite-natural disaster also marked the beginning of a party that hasn't ended yet. Ever since those awful days last year, the country has been celebrating the rich musical heritage of New Orleans. There was a blitz of benefit concerts, including ''From the Big Apple to the Big Easy,'' a pair of shows held simultaneously at Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall last September. A New Orleans jam session closed the show at the Grammy Awards in February. There have been scads of well-intentioned compilations, including ''Our New Orleans: A Benefit Album for the Gulf Coast'' (Nonesuch), ''Hurricane Relief: Come Together Now'' (Concord) and ''Higher Ground Hurricane Relief Benefit Concert'' (Blue Note), a live album recorded at the Jazz at Lincoln Center Benefit. At the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony last month, a video segment paid tribute to New Orleans music through the years, from Louis Armstrong to the Neville Brothers; there was also the inevitable New Orleans jam session.

VDuring Rob Thomas's first week of classes at South Kent School, an elite prep school in this Rockwellian New England town, he used his first writing assignment in his junior English class as a plea. In looping printed letters, which looked like the handwriting of a young girl, Thomas wrote a one-page cry for help: ''I cannot read or write. I need all you people's help. Please do not turn your back on me.''

VAFTER Massachusetts became the first state to enact near-universal health care coverage this month, Robert E. Travaglini, the State Senate president, allowed himself a bit of bravado. ''This is going to be a template for the rest of the nation to follow, and not just this,'' Mr. Travaglini crowed, rattling off a list of recent Massachusetts milestones. ''We did this for same-sex marriage; we did this for stem cell research. Massachusetts is at the head of the curve.''

VA trip to the Statue of Liberty, a spin through the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a Broadway show and a nightcap or three at one of New York's drinking establishments. For locals and out-of-towners alike, the city's bounty of 1,200 bars, lounges and dance clubs is an essential lure of city life. It is also a vital cog in the New York economy, generating an annual $9.7 billion in revenue and employing 19,000 people, according to the New York Nightlife Association. But a series of police raids one night late last month in Manhattan, which led to the shuttering of 5 establishments and the arrest of 20 people on drug charges, left many bar and club owners feeling under siege.

VCountless episodes of the old VH1 series ''Behind the Music'' have drummed into our heads the hazards of living the rock 'n' roll life after a certain age. ''Clean'' is one of the few fiction films to evoke realistically the grubby texture of existence for second- and third-tier rock celebrities crumbling under a combination of fading renown and drug addiction.

VLAST week, the Food and Drug Administration staked out its position on the long-standing controversy over the medical use of marijuana -- and made a lot of people smoking mad. The F.D.A. endorsed a multi-agency study that found that ''no animal or human data supported the safety or efficacy of marijuana for general medical use.'' This came as an affront to those who claim that cannabis is an appropriate treatment for ailments from nausea and vomiting to muscle spasticity and intractable pain. Many news reports and commentaries accused the F.D.A. of contradicting a 1999 report by the Institute of Medicine that recommended further research on marijuana's medical potential. The regulators were denounced as elevating politics over science.

VHere are some favorite ballet DVD's of dance critics of The New York Times. Availability is hard to determine; most of the DVD's here may be found online or in major record or video stores. (An introduction appears on Page 1 of Weekend.) Russian Fantasies in Chelsea I WOULD rather do laundry than watch a ballet on anything but a three-dimensional stage. But there is one undeniable plus to recorded dance (along with not having to remortgage the co-op for the price of a ticket), and that is the way it can plunge the viewer back into history, namely Sunday mornings in the 1970's when balletomanes lined up around the block to watch Soviet ballet films at the old Elgin cinema (now the Joyce Theater in Chelsea).

VSelective listings by critics of The New York Times of new and noteworthy cultural events in the New York metropolitan region this week. * denotes a highly recommended film, concert, show or exhibition.

Roger Kirby's new comedy sends up Wall Street and features a Gordon Gekko-like financial titan.

Keane is about a farmer who has leased a few acres of land and decides to take action when the owner sells the property. In 1990 it was made into a film starring Richard Harris (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. 'HAMLET' Opens on Sunday . Theater by the Blind produces a stripped-down-to-the-basics version of Shakespeare (2:15).

Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. Broadway * 'AWAKE AND SING!' Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter put-downs clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoë Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the stand-outs in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' Madly enjoyable. Alan's Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LESTAT' A musical sleeping pill, adapted from Anne Rice's ''Vampire Chronicles'' and featuring songs by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, that could well give the makers of Ambien a run for their money. Dare to look upon this tale of the undead and keep your eyelids from growing heavier and heavier and heavier (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, near 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'THE PAJAMA GAME' Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) *'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke syntheziers, where kids can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice-versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THREE DAYS OF RAIN' In this revival of Richard Greenberg's slender, elegant drama of family disconnectedness, Julia Roberts is stiff with self-consciousness, glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays and deeply, disturbingly beautiful. Otherwise, it is almost impossible to discern the virtues of the play itself in this wooden and splintered production, directed by Joe Mantello and also starring Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper, who have little chance of capturing the audience's attention (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Presented as a long, pansexual orgy, Scott Elliot's numbing revival of the Brecht-Weill classic feels like a party where the hangover begins almost as soon as the evening does. The starry cast includes Alan Cumming (as Mac the Knife) and a Dietrich-like Cyndi Lauper, though only Jim Dale and Nellie McKay appear to have a clue as to what the show is about (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ASSISTED LOVING' This warm and witty monologue by Bob Morris, who contributes the Age of Dissonance column to the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times, is performed by the author, who chronicles his widowed father's and his own search for love in and around New York. Engaging, subtle and winning (1:10). Daryl Roth Theater, D-Lounge, 103 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (George Hunka) 'BASED ON A TOTALLY TRUE STORY' A chatty, autobiographical comedy by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa about a writer for comic books who moonlights as a screenwriter and playwright. Juggling his two jobs, the busy writer begins backsliding in his unofficial third, ''being a loving, giving, emotionally available boyfriend.'' Minor-key angst ensues in this perky two hours of comic navel-gazing (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) *'BILLY CONNOLLY LIVE!' This popular comedian will remind you of a Scottish George Carlin, with a bit of Eddie Izzard mixed in (2:00). 37 Arts, 450 West 37 Street, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'CIRQUE DU SOLEIL -- CORTEO' The Cirque du Soleil's latest extravaganza, which upholds the ubiquitous Cirque standard, is a fantasy of a dead (though cheerful) clown imagining his own funeral. Unsurprisingly, his cortege is full of circus acts. (2:30). Grand Chapiteau at Randall's Island, (800) 678-5440. (John Rockwell) 'THE CONTRAST' Royall Tyler's slender 1787 romantic comedy -- one of the first professional American plays ever produced -- should be of more interest to historians than to theatergoers (2:30). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) 'DEFIANCE' The second in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality plays that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'J.A.P. CHRONICLES: THE MUSICAL' Isabel Rose, an energetic overachiever, wrote and performs this one-woman show based on her own novel. To her credit, she was willing to hack apart her book to make a viable work of theater, and belts out tunes that are catchy (if uninspired), but the result feels superficial, trafficking in the kinds of obvious stereotypes her background leads you to believe she'd like to challenge (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette) * 'LANDSCAPE OF THE BODY' This terrific revival, directed by Michael Greif, identifies the unbearable wistfulness of being in John Guare's delirious heartbreaker of a comedy from 1977. The top-flight cast is led by Lili Taylor and Sherie Rene Scott as sisters -- one living, one a singing ghost -- who move in and out of a lyrical and sordid world where tabloid prurience has become a religion (2:20). Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Anita Gates) 'RED LIGHT WINTER' A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'A SPALDING GRAY MATTER' This darkly comic solo show, written and performed by Michael Brandt, tells the story of the playwright's own tragic sickness and recovery. It proves that aping Spalding Gray is not easy (1:10). The New Group at Theater Row, Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman) * 'STUFF HAPPENS' Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TRYST' A suspense drama of a distinctly old-fashioned stamp about the romance between a handsome cad (Maxwell Caulfield) and a lonely spinster (Amelia Campbell). Will the wily predator seduce and abandon the mousy milliner? Karoline Leach's play springs a few twists that lack psychological credibility but keep the plot on the boil (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Off Broadway 'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright (Yussef El Guindi) addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after 9/11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) 'COWBOYS!' This melodrama spoof with gay men at the Straight Arrow Ranch makes up for what it lacks in professionalism with a good-natured goofiness (2:10). Wings Theater, 154 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 627-2961. (Gates) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley) 'BRUNDIBAR' and 'BUT THE GIRAFFE, A CURTAIN RAISER TO HANS KRASA'S 'BRUNDIBAR' Hans Krasa's ''Brundibar,'' a lively opera for children, performed 55 times in the Theresienstadt concentration camp, with a new English libretto by Tony Kushner and a curtain-raiser by him that explains its history. Maurice Sendak and Kris Stone designed the charming production (1:35). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Isherwood) 'THE CAINE MUTINY COURT-MARTIAL' An eye-glazing attempt to resurrect Herman Wouk's 1953 courtroom drama, adapted from his novel ''The Caine Mutiny.'' Directed with metronome in hand by Jerry Zaks, and starring David Schwimmer, Tim Daly and Zeljko Ivanek, this workmanlike production gives few clues to the enduring appeal of Mr. Wouk's tale of a humdinger of a typhoon, some disappearing strawberries and a nut job memorably named Queeg (2:15). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Scott Ellis's underpowered production of Joe Orton's great farce of sexual hypocrisy, which stars Alec Baldwin in a comedy sketch of a performance, is breezy, often funny and rarely convincing. (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300; closing on Sunday. (Brantley) 'FAUST, PARTS 1 AND 2' David Herkskovits and his Target Margin Theater's remarkable performers offer the extravaganza promised in the publicity. Faust is a circus of operatic scale, a fun house, a tango of poetry and theatrical and sonic wizardry whose virtuosity renders this work in all its surging strangeness, power and extravagant beauty (6:00). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Honor Moore) 'FESTEN' An intensely staged, indifferently acted production of David Eldridge's adaptation of a 1998 Danish film about a grim family reunion, which was a big hit in London under the same director, Rufus Norris. While the mise en scène remains unsettlingly stark, the Broadway cast (which includes Michael Hayden, Julianna Margulies, Jeremy Sisto and Ali MacGraw) registers the tension and testiness of people suffering from a collective bad hair day. Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing tomorrow. (Brantley) 'A FINE AND PRIVATE PLACE' This musical, based on a 1960 novel by Peter S. Beagle, tells of love in a cemetery that sounds a lot like Woodlawn in the Bronx. One set of would-be lovebirds is living, one recently deceased; the thin story needs a few more memorable songs. York Theater, St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, (212) 868-4444; closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger) * 'I LOVE YOU BECAUSE' The plotline -- single New Yorkers in search of love -- couldn't be more familiar, but somehow this fluffy, funny musical makes it refreshing, helped along by an engaging six-member cast, with David A. Austin making a particularly hilarious impression. An impressive start for Ryan Cunningham (book and lyrics) and Joshua Salzman (music), both still in their 20's (2:00). Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, near Sullivan Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100; closing Sunday. (Neil Genzlinger) 'MARY STUART' An earnest but uninspired revival that never quite captures either the romance or the tragedy of Schiller's play. There are some bright spots, but the production appears aimed more at visual effect than dramatic substance, and both queens seem to have the idea that monarchs exert authority simply by speaking loudly (2:40). The Pearl Theater Company, at Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, at First Avenue, East Village, (212) 598-9802; closing on Sunday. (Wilborn Hampton) 'SORE THROATS' Howard Brenton's scabrous 1979 drama about the bilious aftermath of a British marriage. Laila Robins and Bill Camp are a middle-aged, newly divorced couple warring over the past and the future. The play's insights into the irreducible conflict between human needs and the constraints of civilization are a little murky (2:10). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'THE THREE MUSKETEERS' The Acting Company's elegant, eloquent take on the familiar adventures of Dumas's likable swordsmen is a grand evening of theater (2:30). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Gates) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters operating during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing. (Manohla Dargis) * 'CLEAN' (R, 110 minutes) This fine French movie, written and directed by Olivier Assayas, is one of the few fictional films to evoke realistically the grubby texture of existence for second- and third-tier rock celebrities crumbling under a combination of fading renown and drug addiction. Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte offer memorable portrayals as a recovering junkie and her compassionate father-in-law. (Stephen Holden) 'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (A. O. Scott) * 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-Western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Holden) * 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Dargis) * 'L'ENFANT (THE CHILD)' (R, 100 minutes, in French) The latest from the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne involves a young thief (Jérémie Renier) who one day sells his newborn son for a fat envelope of cash. What interests the Dardennes is not only how a man would sell a child as casually as a slab of beef, but also whether a man like this, having committed such a repellent offense, can find redemption. (Dargis) 'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small- screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis) 'POSEIDON' (PG-13, 100 minutes) Wolfgang Petersen's ''Poseidon'' is unlikely to replace the original in the hearts of action-hungry moviegoers, though it will probably expunge the memory of the earlier, made-for-TV remake (and also, perhaps, of the 1979 sequel, ''Beyond the Poseidon Adventure''). The hard-working cast does a lot of screaming, climbing and death-defying in soaking-wet evening wear, but they can hardly hope to match the ripe absurdity of Shelley Winters, Red Buttons, Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine. (Scott) 'THE PROMISE' (PG-13, 103 minutes, in Mandarin) A lavish spectacle -- somewhere between grand opera and cartoon -- from Chen Kaige, about a love triangle involving a general, a slave and a cursed princess. Sometimes breathtaking, sometimes out of breath. (Scott) 'RUSSIAN DOLLS' (No rating, 129 minutes, in English, Russian, French and Spanish) The sequel to the international hit ''L'Auberge Espagnole'' belongs to a long line of airy French films that induce a pleasant buzz of Euro-envy. Like its forerunner, it is a generational group portrait of young, smart, sexy, well-educated Europeans at work and play filmed in a style that might be called Truffaut Lite. (Holden) * 'STICK IT' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Somersaulting through happy clichés and unexpected invention, this spry teenage comedy gets everything right. (Nathan Lee) * 'THREE TIMES' (No rating, 135 minutes, in Mandarin and Taiwanese dialect) For this hypnotically beautiful cinematic trilogy, the Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien, one of the modern masters of the art, brings us love and loss in three different time periods. (Dargis) 'UNITED 93' (R, 115 minutes) A scrupulously tasteful Hollywood re-creation of the downing of the fourth plane hijacked by Muslim terrorists on Sept. 11 and easily the feel-bad American movie of the year. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, whose earlier films include ''Bloody Sunday.'' (Dargis) 'WAH-WAH' (R, 97 minutes) Scored to the death rattle of the British Empire in Africa, ''Wah-Wah'' observes the disintegration of the Compton family through the eyes of its young son. In his writing and directorial debut, the actor Richard E. Grant probes the pungent details of his own childhood in Swaziland, vividly recreating a community steeped in boredom, booze and casual adultery. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'WATER' (PG-13, 114 minutes, in Hindi) Set in India in 1938, ''Water'' focuses on a group of widows condemned by Hindu law to live in an institution on the banks of the River Ganges. The arrival of a high-spirited 8-year-old girl encourages one widow to question her faith and another to begin a love affair with a Gandhian idealist. Bobbing back and forth between romantic melodrama and spiritual inquiry, ''Water'' is an exquisitely beautiful film about the institutionalized oppression of an entire class of women. (Catsoulis) Film Series ROBERT ALTMAN (Through June 8) This weekend's films at the Museum of the Moving Image's 22-film retrospective of Mr. Altman's work include ''Vincent and Theo'' (1990), about van Gogh's relationship with his brother; ''Three Women'' (1977), a study of gal pals with unusually deep emotional attachments; and ''The Player'' (1992), starring Tim Robbins, the satire that proves once and for all that in Hollywood the writers are dispensable. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10.(Anita Gates) B-NOIR (Through June 15) Film Forum's six-week festival of 70 low-budget American thrillers from the 1940's and 50's continues this weekend with two double features. ''Gun Crazy'' (1949), about a couple on a robbery spree, and ''The Big Combo'' (1955), about a cop determined to nail a Mafia boss, both directed by Joseph H. Lewis, play today and tomorrow. Sunday's double feature is ''Detour'' (1945), the adventures of a hitchhiker who commits identity theft, and ''The Narrow Margin'' (1952), about a beautiful mob-trial witness and her cop bodyguard on a train. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Gates) BOSNIAN-HERZEGOVINIAN FILM FESTIVAL (Through Sunday) Two dozen feature, short and animated films will be screened at Anthology Film Archives in this three-day annual festival. The six films having their American premieres include ''Justice Unseen,'' about the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, and ''Asim Free Man,'' the story of a garbage truck driver who finds solace by playing in a band. 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (917) 302-2702; $10. (Gates) KUROSAWA (Through Sept. 18) The IFC Center's weekend series honoring Akira Kurosawa continues this weekend with ''Rashomon'' (1950), the director's classic drama about the unreliability of eyewitness testimony. The New York Film Critics Circle, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, National Society of Film Critics and National Board of Review all named it best foreign film. 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771; $10.75. (Gates) RIPFEST 8 (Tuesday and Wednesday) This eighth annual festival, at Anthology Film Archives, consists of seven original 10-minute movie musicals made in the 16 days before their premieres. This year's theme is Desperate Measures. 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444; $15. (Gates) SUNDANCE INSTITUTE AT BAM (Through May 21) The Brooklyn Academy of Music is celebrating the Sundance Institute's 25th anniversary with a series of events, including screenings of films from this year's Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. The opening-weekend selections include Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary ''The Trials of Darryl Hunt,'' about a black man wrongly convicted of a white woman's rape and murder; So Yong Kim's ''In Between Days,'' the story of a Korean teenager trying to assimilate into American culture; ''Stephanie Daley,'' a drama about a pregnant forensic psychologist and a teenage girl accused of infanticide; and Goran Dukic's ''Wristcutters: A Love Story,'' a comedy about dead people. 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates) TO SAVE AND PROJECT: THE FOURTH MOMA INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL OF FILM PRESERVATION (Through June 21) This monthlong program of preserved and restored films begins today at the Museum of Modern Art. This weekend's features include ''Menschen am Sonntag'' (1929), a neo-realist Weimar-era German silent with a screenplay by the young Billy Wilder; ''Bunny Lake Is Missing'' (1965), Otto Preminger's swinging-60's-London whodunit with Laurence Olivier and Carol Lynley; and two versions of ''The Mark of Zorro'' (1920 and 1940). Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. ALICE IN CHAINS (Tuesday) In the late 1980's and early 90's, Alice in Chains helped create the Seattle grunge sound by slowing bluesy metal riffs into a lavalike sludge. Now, four years after the death of its singer, Layne Staley -- whose mastery of the nasal snarl remains unmatched -- the surviving members are doing a short tour, with William Duvall in Mr. Staley's place. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Ben Sisario) THE BOOKS (Wednesday) Nick Zammuto and Paul de Jong of the Books make beguiling electronic collages out of disembodied vocal samples, a few plucks from a banjo or another string instrument, and unclassifiable noises that fade in and out like traffic. Part of the pleasure of listening is trying to figure out just why it all works so wonderfully and wittily. At 8 p.m., Courtyard Gallery, World Financial Center, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505; free, but tickets, available at 5 p.m., are required. (Sisario) COHEED AND CAMBRIA, AVENGED SEVENFOLD (Tonight and tomorrow night) With baroque progressive rock riffs that recall Rush, and liberal use of Roman numerals, the group Coheed and Cambria stands out from the painfully earnest emo scene. Avenged Sevenfold's machine-gun rhythms, bumblebee guitar solos and anthemic vocals make a more overt link to bygone metal, particularly that of Iron Maiden and early Metallica. At 7, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Sisario) DUB TRIO (Tuesday) Made up of well-traveled session players for the likes of the Fugees and Mos Def, Dub Trio plays spacious reggae grooves spiked with high-adrenaline punk rock, affectionately recalling Bad Brains. This show celebrates the group's new album, ''New Heavy'' (ROIR), with the guests Dark Room, Beans and Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad. At 7:30 p.m., Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 420-1466; $8. (Sisario) ERASURE (Tonight) This long-running British synth-pop group recently released ''Union Street'' (Mute), recreating some of its B-sides and other lesser-known songs on dobro, pedal steel and nylon-string guitars, prettily but kind of dully. Expect the same at this acoustic show. At 8, New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Sisario) * GNARLS BARKLEY (Monday) One of the most eagerly anticipated concerts this year is by this brilliantly nutty duo featuring the producer-alchemist Danger Mouse and the helium-voiced singer and rapper Cee-Lo Green. Their album ''St. Elsewhere'' (Downtown/Atlantic) giddily tosses together gospel modulations, gorgeous soul, sensory-overload beats and a jumble of pop-culture references. (Surely this is the first hip-hop cover of the Violent Femmes' ''Gone Daddy Gone.'') ''Maybe we're crazy,'' Cee-Lo sings. ''Probably.'' At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Sisario) * ZAKIR HUSSAIN'S MASTERS OF PERCUSSION (Tomorrow) The renowned tabla player Zakir Hussain's annual percussion musicales are leisurely, smiley gatherings, but there is no slacking in the music -- the improvisational give-and-take and deft timing are amazing to behold. This year's guests include the dancing drummers of Manipuri Jagoi Marup, the sarangi player Ustad Sultan Khan and the sitar player Niladri Kumar. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 545-7536; $25 to $35. (Sisario) * SHARON JONES (Tomorrow) The brawny-voiced singer Sharon Jones is the queen of an active local scene that recreates, spiritedly but not too pedantically, the sound of Stax and other beloved 1960's soul labels. Her repertory includes a righteously funky reading of ''This Land Is Your Land.'' Joining her are Binky Griptite, the Budos Band, Naomi Davis and the Gospel Queens, the Mighty Imperials and Antibalas. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $18.50 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario) KANDA BONGO MAN (Tonight) Kanda Bongo Man smoothly croons his songs, as his band plays the gleaming, intertwining guitar lines and lilting rumba rhythms of Congolese soukous. At 11:30, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $25.(Jon Pareles) THE NATIONAL (Sunday) This Brooklyn group has built a significant following with flawless, wilting ballads featuring subtly inventive guitar playing by Bryce Dessner and the dry, cynical baritone of Matt Berninger, who seems pained by his ability to conjure cruelties like ''You could have been a legend/But you became a father.'' Baby Dayliner and Doveman open. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $17 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario) LEE (SCRATCH) PERRY (Thursday) Lee Perry's quirks are inseparable from his inspirations. He is one of reggae's most important producers, using the studio to fill arrangements with distortion, ghostly echoes and disorienting silences. As a performer, he sings and rants, with lucid nuggets surrounded by malarkey as he discourses on space aliens, sex, the International Monetary Fund and marijuana. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Pareles) PSYCHIC ILLS, TELEPATHE, ELECTROPUTAS (Tomorrow) For any bands that play it, an advantage of droning, bad-trip, so-called experimental music is that it never goes out of style, because it has never been in style. These three New York bands reach back to Suicide, Joy Division and German groups like Can for their gray soundscapes, but with twists: Psychic Ills surrounds its guitars with warbling electronics; the two women of Telepathe make it spooky with Bjorkesque vocals and tribal percussion; and Electroputas goes for full disorientation. At 11 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sisario) * RACHEL'S, CLOGS (Thursday) Attempts to bridge classical music with rock are often dry affairs that get neither right. But these two groups, gathered for the ''New Sounds Live'' series with John Schaefer of WNYC, draw exciting music from both sides of the divide in ways that make such distinctions seem silly. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $20. (Sisario) RAINER MARIA (Tomorrow) For nearly a decade, this emo-ish trio could be counted on for big, urgent cries that sounded just a bit louder than the players were comfortable with. But on ''Catastrophe Keeps Us Together'' (Grunion), they have quieted down a bit, and in tender songs like ''Burn'' gained a new sense of control and expressiveness. With Ambulette. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15. (Sisario) * THE ROOTS (Tonight) This veteran hip-hop group from Philadelphia has stuck proudly to socially conscious, we're-all-in-this-together lyrics, but it is its excellence and flexibility as a live funk band that have made its reputation. Here the group serves as both the headliner and the house band for a roster of rap and R & B heroes, including Mos Def and Erykah Badu. At 8, Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171; $50 to $70. (Sisario) 'ROUTE 57: A FESTIVAL OF AMERICAN ROOTS MUSIC' (Monday through Thursday) Carnegie Hall has booked four nights of traditional music from various parts of North America, a good opportunity to hear these musicians in the intimate acoustics of Zankel Hall. Monday features Natalie MacMaster, from the eastern Canadian island of Cape Breton, whose Celtic fiddle leans to bluegrass, and the British singer-storyteller Norman Kennedy. Tuesday offers the New Orleans pianist Henry Butler and Corey Harris, a blues guitarist who had a memorably wide-eyed meeting with the African master Ali Farka Touré in Martin Scorsese's ''Blues'' documentary. On Wednesday the group Ollabelle opens for the Del McCoury Band, the great bluegrass traditionalists who have recently been embraced by the jam-band world. The series closes on Thursday with the folk guitarist Chris Smither and the Campbell Brothers, joyful noisemakers of the sacred steel style, with gospel songs led by blazing slide guitar. At 8:30 p.m., (212) 247-7800; $29 and $35. (Sisario) STEEL PULSE (Wednesday) The close harmonies and steadfast reggae beats of Steel Pulse have carried righteous sentiments about topics including revolution, dancing, Rastafarianism and racist taxi drivers. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $27.50 in advance, $30 at the door. (Pareles) TAJ MAHAL (Tuesday through Thursday) In Taj Mahal's hands, the blues is no weighty downer but a repository of breezy, evocative sounds easily connected to Caribbean and Hawaiian music. At 8 p.m., with an additional show on Thursday at 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $45 at tables, with a $5 minimum, or $35 at the bar, with a one-drink minimum. The fingerpicking bluesman Guy Davis plays on Tuesday and Wednesday at 10:30 p.m.; $15 at tables, with a $5 minimum, or $10 at the bar, with a one-drink minimum. (Sisario) * TOOL (Tonight and tomorrow night) On ''10,000 Days'' (Volcano/Zomba), its first album in five years, Tool sticks to a formula that remains as seductive as ever, with long, cryptic songs that grow steadily from a bass-heavy lurch to heroic bolts of pure guitar. At 9, City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212; sold out. (Sisario) * TOM VERLAINE (Tonight) Tom Verlaine's pulsating, sensuous guitar playing in the 1970's band Television had a lasting effect on rock and postpunk, and in his solo work he has explored meditative improvisations.

(Sisario) WALKMEN (Wednesday) The Walkmen emerged five years ago, playing exquisitely articulated songs of exhaustion and disaffection, with Hamilton Leithauser's weary whine surrounded by an echoey wash of guitar and keyboards.

(Midgette) * 'L'ELISIR D'AMORE' (Tomorrow) The big news of the Met's revival of its 1991 production of Donizetti's ''Elixir of Love'' is the entrancing performance of Ruth Ann Swenson as Adina. Some opera buffs have long found Ms. Swenson's work vocally exquisite but temperamentally bland. Here she brings a breezy comic grace to the role of a wealthy young landowner in an Italian village who thinks herself immune to sentimental notions about love, until the painfully shy peasant Nemorino gets through to her. Ms. Swenson sings with her trademark creamy sound, effortful richness and impressive agility. The promising young Italian tenor Giuseppe Filianoti, in his debut season at the Met, sings Nemorino.

(Allan Kozinn) EARLY MUSIC NEW YORK (Tomorrow) You could call Rameau a new old master: his work has been increasingly explored and performed in the last few decades. Early Music New York isn't the first group to present his opera and ballet suites this season -- Les Violins du Roy did it well in February, and Emmanuelle Haïm at Mostly Mozart last summer -- which just goes to show that the music is well worth hearing.

At 8, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 780-2181; $20 to $45. (Kozinn) DAVID RUSSELL (Sunday) Benjamin Britten's Cello Suites are extraordinary essays, modern equivalents of Bach's unaccompanied cello works. Like the Bach set, they are technically demanding and leave a cellist nowhere to hide, as David Russell will demonstrate in a promising traversal. At 4 p.m., St. Peter's Episcopal Church, 346 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-2390; $10; $5 for students and 65+.

At 7 p.m., various locations, the South Street Seaport, Lower Manhattan, www.lmcc.net/sitelines; free. (Anderson) TAP CITY YOUTH ENSEMBLE (Sunday) Dance lovers can watch tap dancing while they shop. At 5 p.m., Capezio Dance Theater Shop, 1650 Broadway, entrance on 51st Street, (212) 245-2130; free. (Anderson) * CHRISTOPHER WILLIAMS (Tonight through Sunday) Mr. Williams, a dancer and choreographer who has worked with the puppeteer Basil Twist, made the remarkable ''Ursula and the 11,000 Virgins'' at Performance Space 122. This new program offers more medievally inspired choreography: his ''Portuguese Suite'' and three solos from ''The Golden Legend,'' a male adjunct to the female ''Ursula,'' with John Kelly as one of the performers. At 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or danspaceproject.org; $15. (Rockwell) * WORK IN PROCESS: NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Sunday and Monday) Peter Martins, who directs City Ballet, will lead a discussion with the Diamond Project choreographers Jorma Elo and Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux.

(Dunning) ZVIDANCE (Wednesday and Thursday) New works by Zvi Gotheiner include ''Les Noces,'' his version of Stravinsky's ballet about marriage, and ''12A,'' a commentary on superstitions about the number 13, to a commissioned score by Scott Killian. (Through May 27.) At 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077; $25, $15 students and 65+. (Anderson) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. Few exhibitions this size (35 pieces) present quite such a vivid and rewarding picture of artistic assimilation and transformation. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'AMERICAN STREAMLINED DESIGN: THE WORLD OF TOMORROW,' through June 11. Streamlining, a particularly American design concept born of our love of speed and admiration for industrial production, peaked in the 1930's and 40's, and is now said to be undergoing a revival. This tribute to it includes more than 180 objects, from boring but useful items like a receipt printer designed by Walter Dorwin Teague in 1946 to a plastic bicycle helmet of flowing teardrop shapes designed by John Larkin in 2000. The show is perhaps too packed with repetitive examples -- do we need to see three similar electric drills? -- but don't let that stop you. There's no shortage of wonderful things to look at here. 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000. (Grace Glueck) * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Glueck) * Brooklyn Museum: WILLIAM WEGMAN: 'FUNNEY/STRANGE,' through May 28. Descended from Marcel Duchamp and Buster Keaton, Mr. Wegman has straddled high and low for more than three decades, using his signature Weimaraners to make the art world's funniest videos, as well as television commercials, calendars and children's books. His popular success has tended to obscure his originality and influence, along with a multifarious production that includes wittily captioned drawings, wonderfully irreverent paintings and a host of nondog photographic work. (See above.) (Smith) * FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' through July 16. Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love.'' 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Glueck) * International Center of Photography: 'Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography,' through May 28. If Martians tuned into our television news broadcasts, they'd have a miserable impression of life on Earth. War, disease, poverty, heartbreak and nothing else. That's exactly how most of the world sees Africa: filtered through images of calamity. The Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor offers a bracing alternative view in this show of recent photography from Africa. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000.(Holland Cotter) JEWISH MUSEUM: 'EVA HESSE: SCULPTURE,' through Sept. 17. Assembled by Elizabeth Sussman, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Fred Wasserman, a curator at the Jewish Museum, this show focuses on a pivotal Hesse exhibition, ''Chain Polymers,'' at the Fischbach Gallery -- known for promoting Minimalist painters -- in 1968. Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it -- along with some earlier and later pieces -- are here. One of the earliest is ''Compart'' (1966), a four-panel vertical that starts at the top with a fully formed, round, breastlike image of neatly wound cord that mysteriously breaks up into part of the same image on each of the three panels beneath. The last, most startling and most impressive work is ''Untitled (Rope Piece),'' of 1970, made as Ms. Hesse was dying, finished with the help of friends. (An exhibition of her drawings is on view at the Drawing Center.) 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck) * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ANGLOMANIA: TRADITION AND TRANSGRESSION IN BRITISH FASHION,' through Sept. 4. Ranging from early-18th-century gowns to next season's evening wear, this show crowds 65 extravagantly clad mannequins into the Met's normally serene English period rooms, trying to connect the sartorial innovations of the English dandy, the aggressive tribal attire of punk and the deconstructive impulses of today's British fashion stars. A certain confusion, both intellectual and visual reigns, but there is more than enough to look at. (212) 535-7710. (Smith) MET: 'HATSHEPSUT,' through July 9. Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Met's department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (See above.) (Glueck) * Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,' through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontes to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or themorgan.org. ( Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) (Cotter) Museum of Modern Art : 'AGAINST THE GRAIN: CONTEMPORARY ART FROM THE EDWARD R. BROIDA COLLECTION' The latest collection assembled by the Museum of Modern Art bolsters its holdings of art world mavericks like Philip Guston, Jennifer Bartlett, Ken Price and Vija Celmins and includes first-timers like Robert Grosvenor, John Lees and Susana Solano. It also illuminates parts of the untold, or forgotten, stories of the art of the 1970's and 80's: the achievements of painters and sculptors who were not at the forefront of Post-Minimalism, photo appropriation or Neo-Expressionism. Some of their efforts may disappear into storage, but quite a few will shake up the Modern's conception of the complicated course of art since 1970. The Museum of Modern Art, (212) 708-9400, through Sept. 18. (Smith) * The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art: abstraction. This show is stylishly installed; the 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. One, the sculptor Tom Lloyd (1921-96), opened the Studio Museum with a solo show in 1968. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here harks back to that moment. (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Michael Kimmelman) Galleries: SoHo 'EVA HESSE: DRAWING' This show deals in depth with Ms. Hesse's works on paper, ranging from rough sketches or notes, to test pieces made from various materials that function as drawings, to finished projects that stand on their own. A zealous researcher, Ms. Hesse made all kinds of thumbnail notations and calculations to explore the properties of her malleable materials. Many of these sheets, perhaps too many, are shown, too. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through July 15. (Glueck) * Josephsohn A powerful exhibition of five crusty, semi-abstract, oversized heads cast in bronze by a Zurich-based sculptor who was born in East Prussia in 1920. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441, through May 27. (Ken Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea Julia Condon: 'Mandalas' Inspired by Tibetan tradition, Ms. Condon uses many thin glazes on square canvases to create entrancing, soft-focus mandalas in which diaphanous crystalline and floral patterns radiate from glowing centers. Dinter Fine Art, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 947-2818, through June 3. (Johnson) Justin Craun: 'The Individual' Inspired partly by kitschy Christian record album cover images from the 1950's, this inventive young painter creates acidic, vividly abstracted and patterned portraits of people who look as if they've been possessed by evil aliens from outer space. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, (212) 633-6555, through June 10. (Johnson) Judy Glantzman Her congested expressionistic paintings composed of scores of little human heads are like visions of hell by the Belgian Symbolist James Ensor. Also on view are scary and funny little doll-like figures made of a material called Super Sculpy. Betty Cuningham, 541 West 25th Street, (212) 242-2772, through next Friday. (Johnson) Ilya & Emilia Kabakov The painter, sculptor, storyteller and Conceptualist Mr. Kabakov and his partner, Emilia Kabakov, present a series of paintings they made recently, but that museum-style labels claim were made in the 1970's by Ilya Kabakov, who may or may not be the same person as the author of this exhibition. The paintings adroitly mix passages of Modernist abstraction and social realism, but the real interest is in the idea of the art history of an alternative universe. Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181, through May 27. (Johnson) 'Never Mind the Bollocks: Here's Amanda Lear' Muse, film actress, professional Somebody, Amanda Lear is also a painter, as her oil portraits of Francis Bacon, Salvador Dalí and Leonardo da Vinci attest. But the point of the show is to pay homage to Ms. Lear herself, and some interesting artists: Scott Hug, Kanishka Raja, Ryan Steadman and James. J. Williams III, with paintings; Michelle Lopez and Anna Sew Hoy, with small sculptures; and -- best -- Christoph Broich with a large work of latex and lace titled ''The Girl Who Sold Her Soul to the Devil and Won.'' Envoy, 535 West 22nd Street, sixth floor, (212) 242-7524, through June 3. (Cotter) * Rosalind Solomon, 'American Pictures from Chapalingas' This excellent exhibition of works from 1974 to 2000 surveys the career of a photographer with a keen eye for human individuality and a pitch-perfect sense of composition. Her art bears a family resemblance to that of Diane Arbus, but it is gentler and kinder. Foley, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 244-9081, through June 3. (Johnson) Christoph Worringer In his large-scale allegories, this young German painter features multiple images of himself with pupil-less eyes in mysterious theatrical situations. Whatever they may mean, it is tantalizing to imagine where Mr. Worringer's blend of traditionalist figurative painting and Postmodernist surrealism might lead. Lucas Schoormans, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 243-3159, through June 10. (Johnson) Other Galleries Glen Fogel and Yoko Inoue Yoko Inoue, born in Japan, looks at what it is to be American in a solo show that includes a stack of woolen ''Old Glory'' sweaters made by weavers in South America, and a series of portraits of Ms. Inoue made by other artists. A new video by Glen Fogel, shot during the Billy Graham Crusade at Flushing Meadows, Queens, in 2005, focuses on the Christian rock bands that served as warm-up acts for Mr. Graham. The musicians look as if they could be from the 1960's, though the message they are delivering is very different. Or is it? Momenta, 72 Berry Street, near North Ninth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-8058, through June 12. (Cotter) 'Mystic River' The artist Noah Sheldon has assembled a lyrical group show not quite of this world. Dike Blair makes an unearthly thing of Las Vegas in a fine watercolor painting; the excellent Peter Coffin contributes a portrait in the form of a photographed aura; Martha Friedman offers a levitating rope; Ian Hundley displays a patch of aerial topography in the form of a crazy quilt; Roger White paints the sun. The spirit of Stephen Shore's 1970's photographs of the American landscape flows through it all. Southfirst, 60 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-4884, through June 11. (Cotter) Last Chance Yto Barrada The French-Moroccan photographer Yto Barrada, recently seen in ''Snap Judgments'' at the International Center of Photography, makes a New York solo debut with this show. It includes excerpts from her documentation of the lives of North African immigrants legally barred from entry to Europe and passing time in the city of Tangier on the Strait of Gibraltar. Also on view is Ms. Barrada's wonderful video of a street magician in action. The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) DAHESH MUSEUM OF ART: 'Stories to Tell: Masterworks from the Kelly Collection of American Illustration,' . During the Golden Age of Illustration -- the 1880's to the 1930's -- images made by painters for magazines and books captivated the collective American psyche. Original works by some of the best of those artists, including J. C. Leyendecker, N. C. Wyeth and Charles Dana Gibson, are included in this extensive and well-selected exhibition. 580 Madison Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 759-0606; closes on Sunday. (Johnson) * 'Great Pots: The Vessel as Art, 1900 to 2000' This extraordinarily rich and varied lobby show presents 164 works by 143 artists from the Newark Museum's famed ceramics collection. It focuses on utilitarian vessels -- vases, bowls, pots, mugs and platters -- but covers an enormous amount of aesthetic territory, taking in Pueblo Indian, Arts and Crafts, classical Japanese, European Modernist, Pop, funk and much more. The show includes great craftsmen like George Orr, Beatrice Wood, Peter Voulkos and Ron Nagel. The UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, near 51st Street, (212) 713-2885; closes today. (Johnson) * The Museum of Modern Art: 'Without Boundary: Seventeen Ways of Looking' This excellent group show considers what ''Islamic'' means in the work of several contemporary artists, and it means many things, none simple. Just to see the uses made of calligraphy by Shirazeh Houshiary, Rachid Koraichi and Shirin Neshat is to understand the lesson in variety put forward here. (212) 708-9400; closes on Monday. (Cotter) NEUE GALERIE: 'KLEE AND AMERICA,' For a long time, the Swiss-born artist Paul Klee (1879-1940), regarded as a leading Modernist figure in Europe, didn't believe his delicate, chimerical work had much of a future in the United States. Yet, thanks to artists, collectors and dealers with close contacts in Germany who had begun to discover his work, by the early 1920's, Klee's impact began to be felt here. This show of more than 60 paintings and drawings assembled from American holdings covers the spectrum of Klee's work. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200; closes on Monday. (Glueck) 'Cady Noland Approximately' This Conceptual stunt of an exhibition presents 11 simulations of works by the influential and much admired sculptor Cady Noland, an artist known for carefully controlling where and when her works are exhibited. Triple Candie, 461 West 126th Street, Harlem, (212) 865-0783; closes on Sunday. (Johnson) * Aaron Parazette: 'All On Up' This Houston-based painter creates punchy, colorful, sign-like compositions, using big letters as his basic building blocks. The letters spell words like insane, juice and thruster, but they are variously inverted, reversed and mixed up to enhance the exceptionally gratifying graphic impact. Marlborough Chelsea, 211 West 19th Street, (212) 463-8634; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)

VSweeps month rolls on. NBC's ''10.5: APOCALYPSE'' (Sunday and Tuesday nights at 9) is a sequel to a 2004 disaster film in which the West Coast was devastated by an earthquake that surely qualified as ''the big one.'' But my oh my, now there's an even worse earthquake coming. One seismologist (FRANK LANGELLA) has predicted that it could create a continental divide right down the middle of the United States. BEAU BRIDGES is the president, KIM DELANEY a determined seismologist, DAVID CUBITT her ex-boyfriend and GARCELLE BEAUVAIS-NILON the FEMA boss. When Stephen King thinks about the apocalypse, he heads for Nevada (at least Las Vegas was the Antichrist's headquarters in ''The Stand''). The title of ''STEPHEN KING'S DESPERATION'' (ABC, Tuesday night at 8), a three-hour movie, refers to Desperation, Nev., where hapless motorists are stopped by a local lawman (RON PERLMAN), framed for marijuana possession and thrown in jail. The scary part is that dead people are lying all over town, and the cop is possessed by something evil. TOM SKERRITT, ANNABETH GISH, MATT FREWER and CHARLES DURNING are among the inmates. It's highly self-referential. (Yes, that's ''redrum'' written on a wall.) One more time, it's the ''AMERICAN IDOL'' season finale on Fox. CHRIS DAUGHTRY, who even the notoriously demanding SIMON COWELL predicted would win, is gone. On Tuesday night at 8 the two finalists perform. Then the producers stretch out Wednesday night's show (also at 8), when the winner is announced, to two hours. That includes a reunion of the Top 12, but some people will still watch only the last 10 minutes. For those not swept up so much by sweeps, ''JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER'' comes out as a two-disc DVD set (Sony Pictures, $19.94) on Tuesday. That means nine fairy tales (including one that asks whether a king will marry his beautiful daughter off to a hedgehog) and four Greek myths with decidedly uncuddly puppets.
